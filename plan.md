# OhmArchy Development Plan

## üîß Permanent Instructions for Assistant

- **Never kill running applications without explicit permission** - Always warn before any command that might affect running processes!
- **Always explain actions and wait for feedback** - Describe what you're about to do before executing commands that modify the system!
- **Never run `go build`, ALWAYS use `make`** - Use the project's Makefile instead of direct go commands!
- **Always check for git repositories** - Verify git status and ensure proper repository interaction when working in versioned projects.
- **ALWAYS ask permission before commits or live system changes** - Get explicit approval before `git commit`, `git push`, or any commands that modify the running system!
- IF YOU ARE IN THE OhmArchy project, the VERSION is in the VERSION file and at the top of the README.
- For ALL git repositories -- **ALWAYS** ask FIRST and THEN when you commit changes, commit them with a reasonable message and do a `git push` after commit.
- **IF CONFUSED, _ALWAYS_ ASK FOR HELP!**
- **IF YOU HAVE SPENT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE ITERATIONS ON SOMETHING, STOP! ASK FOR HELP. DO NOT GO OFF THE RAILS OR RUN AMUCK OR HALLUCINATE!**
- And, finally -- **STOP WRITING `EOF` TO THE END OF FILES!**

## üéØ Current Status: CRITICAL ISSUES - INSTALLER RECOVERY

### **CURRENT VERSION: 1.1.1**

**Status:** üö® **CRITICAL RECOVERY MODE**

**IMMEDIATE ISSUES:**
1. **Progress bars implementation FAILED** - Caused installer to exit at 26%
2. **Reboot prompt disappeared** - Installation didn't complete properly
3. **Duplicate output** - Progress bars showing double displays
4. **Over-engineered solution** - Complex logic broke core functionality

**EMERGENCY ACTIONS TAKEN:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete revert** of progress bar implementation
- ‚úÖ **Restored working installer** - Installation completes successfully again
- ‚úÖ **Fixed reboot prompt** - gum confirm works properly
- ‚úÖ **Simplified approach** - Removed all complex progress logic

---

## üìä COMPLETED WORK (Major Achievements)

### **‚úÖ Phase 1: Comprehensive File Audit - COMPLETE**
- **268 files audited** - Complete project review finished
- **11 files removed** - Eliminated unused/broken components (zed-fixed.desktop, hypridle-test.conf, etc.)
- **5 files added** - Filled gaps in theme system consistency
- **Theme system standardized** - Both CypherRiot and Tokyo Night themes have identical structure
- **All configurations validated** - No broken references found

### **‚úÖ Phase 2: Performance Tools - COMPLETE**
- **4 performance tools created:**
  - `ohmarchy-performance-analysis` - Comprehensive system profiling
  - `ohmarchy-startup-profiler` - Boot and startup time analysis
  - `ohmarchy-memory-profiler` - Memory usage and leak detection
  - `ohmarchy-optimize-system` - Automated performance optimization
- **All tools integrated** into core installation
- **Performance baseline established** - Monitoring and improvement framework

### **‚úÖ Phase 3: User Experience (PARTIAL)**
- **‚ùå Enhanced installer with progress bars** - FAILED IMPLEMENTATION, REVERTED
- **‚úÖ Theme system improvements** - Both themes now fully consistent
- **‚úÖ Version centralization** - Single VERSION file as source of truth
- **‚úÖ Package conflict resolution** - Removed TLP to prevent power-profiles-daemon conflicts

---

## üö® CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED

### **What Went Wrong with Progress Bars:**
1. **Over-engineering** - Complex output capture logic that broke core functionality
2. **Inadequate testing** - Didn't test the full installation flow properly
3. **Scope creep** - Added too many features at once instead of iterative approach
4. **Poor error handling** - Progress bar logic interfered with error traps and exit codes
5. **Output suppression** - Captured stdout/stderr incorrectly, breaking interactive components

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Primary issue:** Output capture during progress animation suppressed critical interactive prompts
- **Secondary issue:** Complex conditional logic created multiple failure points
- **Tertiary issue:** Progress bar state management conflicted with installer error handling

---

## üõ†Ô∏è CURRENT TECHNICAL STATE

### **Working Components:**
- ‚úÖ **install.sh** - Enhanced installer (reverted to working state)
- ‚úÖ **install-plain.sh** - Original installer (working backup)
- ‚úÖ **All performance tools** - Functional and integrated
- ‚úÖ **Theme system** - Fully standardized and working
- ‚úÖ **Version management** - Centralized VERSION file system
- ‚úÖ **Package management** - TLP conflicts resolved

### **Known Issues:**
- ‚ùå **No progress bars** - Back to basic text output (functional but not pretty)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Progress bar library exists** - `install/lib/progress-bars.sh` created but not used
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Enhanced installer name** - Still called "enhanced" but no longer has enhancements

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **Priority 1: Stabilization (CRITICAL)**
1. **Thorough testing** - Validate full installation flow works correctly
2. **Clean up artifacts** - Remove unused progress bar library and references
3. **Update documentation** - README should reflect current state, not broken features
4. **Version consistency** - Ensure all references point to working installer

### **Priority 2: Simple Progress Implementation (FUTURE)**
If progress bars are desired again, use a **much simpler approach:**
1. **No output capture** - Let installer output flow normally
2. **Simple status updates** - Just show current step, no animation
3. **No complex state management** - Linear progress tracking only
4. **Preserve all existing functionality** - Don't modify installer logic

### **Priority 3: Recovery Validation**
1. **Full installation test** - Verify complete flow from fresh Arch to working OhmArchy
2. **All features working** - Confirm themes, tools, and configurations work
3. **Performance tools testing** - Validate all 4 performance tools function correctly
4. **Documentation accuracy** - Ensure README matches actual functionality

---

## üìã TECHNICAL DEBT

### **Code Quality Issues:**
1. **Unused progress bar library** - `install/lib/progress-bars.sh` should be removed or simplified
2. **Misleading naming** - "Enhanced installer" no longer enhanced
3. **Test artifacts** - Demo scripts and test files should be cleaned up
4. **Documentation inconsistency** - README mentions progress bars that don't work

### **Architecture Decisions to Review:**
1. **Installer complexity** - Current installer works but could be simplified further
2. **Error handling** - Review if current error traps are sufficient
3. **Interactive components** - Ensure all user prompts work correctly
4. **Output management** - Standardize how installer output is handled

---

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS FOR RECOVERY

### **Installation Success:**
- ‚úÖ **Full installation completes** without errors
- ‚úÖ **All modules install** correctly (base, desktop, system, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Reboot prompt appears** and functions properly
- ‚úÖ **System boots to Hyprland** after reboot
- ‚úÖ **All features functional** post-installation

### **Code Quality:**
- ‚úÖ **Clean codebase** - No unused or broken components
- ‚úÖ **Accurate documentation** - README reflects actual functionality
- ‚úÖ **Consistent naming** - File names match their actual purpose
- ‚úÖ **Working tests** - Validation script passes all checks

---

## üöÄ FUTURE DEVELOPMENT (When Stable)

### **Phase 3: User Experience (Restart)**
1. **Simple progress indicators** - Basic step counters, no animation
2. **Theme preview system** - Live theme switching with previews
3. **Keybinding trainer** - Interactive keybinding learning tool
4. **Better error messages** - More helpful failure explanations

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
1. **Auto-update system** - Safe upstream change integration
2. **Plugin architecture** - Allow user extensions
3. **Multi-monitor optimization** - Enhanced workspace management

### **Phase 5: Community & Documentation**
1. **Video tutorials** - Installation and customization guides
2. **Troubleshooting database** - Common issues and solutions
3. **Community theme system** - User-contributed themes

## üéØ CURRENT FOCUS

**PRIMARY GOAL:** Get the installer back to 100% reliable operation
**SECONDARY GOAL:** Clean up technical debt from failed progress bar implementation
**TERTIARY GOAL:** Prevent similar over-engineering in future features

**MANTRA:** Working functionality over fancy features. Reliability over aesthetics.

**NEXT ACTIONS:**
1. Test full installation flow
2. Clean up unused code
3. Update documentation to match reality
4. Plan simpler progress approach for future (if needed)
