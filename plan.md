# ArchRiot Development Plan

## üöß CURRENT TASKS

### TASK 1: Hyprlock Screen Dynamic Theming - DEFERRED

**PRIORITY: LOW**

**Current Status:**

- ‚ùå **Complex implementation challenges** - Multiple failed approaches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Template preservation issues** - Difficult to maintain all UI elements
- üîÑ **Needs simpler approach** - Current pattern doesn't fit hyprlock's complex config

**Lessons Learned:**

- Hyprlock has complex nested config with many label sections for UI elements
- Template-based replacement is error-prone due to formatting complexity
- String replacement approaches break the rich UI (time, date, system stats)
- Config generation approach loses important template elements
- Unlike other apps, hyprlock requires preserving extensive formatting and comments

**Proposed Solution for Future:**

- Study simpler approaches like CSS variable injection (if hyprlock supports it)
- Consider leaving hyprlock with static theming only (it's a lock screen, not primary UI)
- Focus resources on more impactful theming targets

## ‚è≠Ô∏è IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### üîÑ Phase 1: Complete Hyprlock Integration

1. **Focus on remaining high-impact theming targets**
2. **Consider hyprlock static-only acceptable for lock screen**
3. **Research if hyprlock adds theme variable support in future versions**
4. **Prioritize applications users interact with more frequently**

### üîÑ Phase 2: Remaining ArchRiot Applications

**KNOWN ISSUE: Ghostty Real-time Reload**

- Current: Static file updates (users must manually reload with Ctrl+Shift+,)
- Research status: SIGUSR2 not implemented in Ghostty 1.0/1.1
- Priority: LOW (existing functionality works, just not real-time)

**Potential candidates for theming integration:**

- **btop** (`config/btop/`) - System monitor with color themes
- **mako** (`config/mako/`) - Notification daemon styling
- **fastfetch** (`config/fastfetch/`) - System info display colors
- **fish** (`config/fish/`) - Shell prompt and syntax highlighting

### üîÑ Phase 3: System-wide Integration

- **gtk-3.0/gtk-4.0** (`config/gtk-*/`) - System-wide application theming
- **Thunar** (`config/Thunar/`) - File manager theming
- **Neovim** - Dynamic colorscheme generation

## üöß OTHER TASKS

### TASK 2: Secure Boot Implementation Overhaul

**PRIORITY: MEDIUM**

- **Problem:** Current implementation disabled due to boot failures
- **Solution:** Replace manual OpenSSL approach with reliable `sbctl`
- **Status:** Deferred until theming system complete

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Current Architecture (v2.25):**

```
source/theming/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theming.go              // Core orchestration + matugen integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ registry.go             // Coordinates all theme appliers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ applications/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.go           // Shared MatugenColors + ThemeApplier interface
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ waybar.go          // Waybar colors.css + SIGUSR2 reload
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zed.go             // Zed theme_overrides
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ghostty.go         // Ghostty terminal palette
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hyprland.go        // Hyprland window borders
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ texteditor.go      // Text Editor XML themes + gsettings
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fuzzel.go          // Fuzzel launcher RGBA colors
```

**Optional Extensions:**

- [ ] **Ghostty real-time reload** - Config refresh without restart
- [ ] **btop system monitor** - Color theme coordination
- [ ] **mako notification daemon** - Notification styling
- [ ] **System-wide GTK theming** - Application-wide consistency

### Key Principles

- **Matugen does color science** - appliers just update config files
- **Single responsibility** - each applier handles one application
- **Graceful failure** - individual applier errors don't break system
- **Research-driven** - understand existing mechanisms before implementing
- **Proper contrast** - maintain readability with dark backgrounds and dynamic accents
- **One change at a time** - wait for feedback after each modification

## üîß TECHNICAL

DEBT

- Installation process optimization - **RESOLVED v2.25**
- Background/theme reversion after reboot - **RESOLVED v2.24**

## üèÜ ACHIEVEMENTS

**Dynamic Theming System v2.25:**

- **6 applications** integrated with dynamic theming (all tested and working)
- **100% persistence** - all settings survive reboot with bulletproof config reading
- **Unified control** - CLI commands and Control Panel interface working perfectly
- **Professional architecture** - clean, maintainable, extensible applier system
- **Proven stability** - handles errors gracefully, no breaking changes
- **Lightning-fast setup** - 26MB download vs 297MB, seconds vs minutes

---

**Current Status:** Core dynamic theming system is complete and production-ready. All critical ArchRiot applications support dynamic theming with proper persistence, fast installation, and reliable user controls.

Next Action: Research and design a simpler approach for hyprlock theming based on lessons learned from failed complex implementation.

Completed Since v2.30

- [‚úÖ] Waybar recording indicator (Kooha): Active-only red dot placed at the left-most of modules-right before the tray; click-to-stop sends a graceful signal to Kooha. Implemented via a lightweight PipeWire detector shell script with no idle UI footprint.

Optimization and Reliability Roadmap (Prioritized)

1. Waybar portability
    - Remove hardcoded network interface from Waybar network module or source it from a central defaults file.
    - Replace hardcoded hwmon temperature paths with thermal_zone-based detection or a runtime resolver script to avoid N/A readings across machines.

2. Portals consistency
    - Add xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland and xdg-desktop-portal-gtk to package set to match portals.conf for consistent screencast, screenshot, and file chooser behavior.
    - Optional: enforce GTK_USE_PORTAL=1 for targeted apps that require consistent portal backends.

3. PipeWire/WirePlumber realtime
    - Include rtkit and verify PipeWire/WirePlumber run with realtime scheduling for glitch-free audio and reliable screencasts under load.

4. Storage maintenance
    - Enable fstrim.timer for SSD health and sustained I/O performance.

5. Waybar reload policy
    - Prefer signal-based reloads (SIGUSR2) over kill+restart for flicker-free updates and fewer duplicate instances. Standardize all installer/update flows on signals.

6. Memory tuning by RAM size
    - Compute vm.min_free_kbytes proportionally to total RAM (cap at ~1GB) during install; retain current vm.\* tuning otherwise.
    - Optional: provide an opt-in zram module (zram-generator) for low/mid RAM machines.

7. GPU driver detection/install
    - Detect GPU via lspci and install appropriate stacks (NVIDIA packages and utils; VAAPI/Vulkan for AMD/Intel) and video acceleration bits to reduce first-boot graphics issues.

8. Power profiles automation (opt-in)
    - Optional system policy to auto-switch power-profiles-daemon (balanced on AC, power-saver on battery), behind a toggle.

9. Hyprlock refresh tuning
    - Reduce command label update intervals on the lock screen (e.g., from 2s to 5‚Äì10s) to lower background CPU usage while locked.

10. Secure Boot guided flow

- Implement an end-to-end sbctl-backed flow: key generation, enrollment, kernel/bootloader signing, verification, and a clear user checklist for next reboot.

11. Optional systemd-oomd

- Offer systemd-oomd with conservative defaults as an opt-in resilience feature for better recovery under extreme memory pressure.

Decisions

- App launcher: Keep Fuzzel; do not adopt Walker.

Validation checklist for changes

- Waybar shows accurate network/temp info on diverse hardware without manual edits.
- Portals work consistently with hyprland/gtk; Kooha screencast reliability improved.
- PipeWire/WirePlumber run with rtkit; no audio drops under typical loads.
- fstrim.timer enabled and active.
- Waybar reloads are signal-driven across all flows.
- Memory heuristics adapt to total RAM; optional zram available.
- GPU drivers and acceleration auto-installed based on detected hardware.
- Power profile auto-switching remains opt-in and reversible.
- Hyprlock CPU usage reduced while locked.
- Secure Boot wizard completes with sbctl and provides a clear reboot-time checklist.
- Optional systemd-oomd ships disabled by default with a toggle in Control Panel.
