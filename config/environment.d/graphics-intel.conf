# Graphics Environment Configuration - Intel GPU
# Optimized for Intel integrated graphics with Mesa drivers

# Use stable GL renderer for GTK4 stability
export GSK_RENDERER=gl

# Intel systems generally work well with default Mesa drivers
# Hardware acceleration remains enabled for best performance

# Note: Intel integrated graphics rarely have GTK4 rendering issues
# Minimal configuration keeps hardware acceleration active
