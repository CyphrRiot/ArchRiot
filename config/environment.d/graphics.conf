# Universal Graphics Configuration
# Software rendering for GTK4 stability across all GPU types (AMD, Intel, NVIDIA)

# Use GL renderer for GTK4 (more stable than NGL)
GSK_RENDERER=gl

# Force software rendering to prevent GTK4 artifacts in Thunar and other apps
# This fixes visual corruption/artifacts on all GPU types
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1

# Note: Software rendering trades slight performance for complete stability
# Perfect for desktop applications, file managers, and GTK4 apps
