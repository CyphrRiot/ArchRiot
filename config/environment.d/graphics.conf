# Graphics Environment Configuration
# Fixes rendering artifacts in GTK applications like Thunar

# Use software rendering for GTK4 applications to prevent graphics artifacts
# This fixes flashing icons, mouse trails, and other rendering issues
# on both AMD and Intel graphics hardware
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1

# Alternative: Vulkan renderer (faster but causes crashes in Thunar)
# export GSK_RENDERER=vulkan

# Note: Software rendering is slower but stable and avoids both
# OpenGL hardware acceleration bugs and Vulkan crashes
