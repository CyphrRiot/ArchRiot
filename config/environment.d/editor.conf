# Editor Environment Configuration
# Sets default editor for system commands like visudo, crontab, git commit, etc.

# Primary editor used by most command-line tools
export EDITOR=nvim

# Visual editor (used by some programs as fallback)
export VISUAL=nvim

# Note: This ensures visudo, crontab, git, and other system commands
# will use neovim instead of vi/vim by default
