# ArchRiot Memory Management Optimization
# Fixes Linux's aggressive caching behavior that consumes all available RAM

# Reserve 1GB of free memory (1048576 KB)
# Prevents system from caching everything and struggling to free memory when needed
vm.min_free_kbytes=1048576

# Reduce VFS cache pressure - be less aggressive about caching file system metadata
# Default is 100, setting to 50 makes kernel less likely to reclaim directory/inode caches
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50

# Reduce swappiness - prefer to use RAM before swapping to disk
# Default is 60, setting to 10 makes system much less likely to swap
vm.swappiness=10

# Limit dirty pages to 5% of memory before forcing writes
# Prevents large write bursts that can cause system lag
vm.dirty_ratio=5

# Start background writeback at 2% dirty pages
# Earlier writeback prevents dirty page buildup
vm.dirty_background_ratio=2

# Disable zone reclaim mode for better NUMA performance
# Prevents unnecessary memory reclaim on NUMA systems
vm.zone_reclaim_mode=0
