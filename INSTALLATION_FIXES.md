2. **system** - System functionality
3. **desktop** - Desktop environment and theming
4. **development** - Editors (includes Zed Wayland integration)
5. **applications** - User apps (includes all fixed apps and Signal Wayland)
6. **optional** - Now mostly empty (apps moved to main installers)

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results After Fresh Install

A fresh OhmArchy installation should now have:

1. **AbiWord** available in Wofi launcher
2. **Feather Wallet** with beautiful feather icon in Wofi
3. **Signal** launching with native Wayland (no grey borders)
4. **Zed** launching with native Wayland and proper theming
5. **Wofi** with balanced 24px icons and 16px text
6. **Dark file dialogs** in all applications (no more white Signal dialogs)
7. **Proper DPI scaling** for all applications
8. **No Ark or Micro** installed by default

## ðŸ”§ Manual Verification Commands

After a fresh install, verify with:

```bash
# Check applications are installed
pacman -Q abiword featherwallet-bin signal-desktop zed

# Check launchers are available
which signal-wayland zed-wayland

# Check desktop files exist
ls ~/.local/share/applications/ | grep -E "(feather|signal|zed)"

# Check Wofi config
cat ~/.config/wofi/config | grep image_size  # Should show 24

# Check GTK dark theme
cat ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini | grep dark  # Should show true

# Test Wofi appearance (balanced icons/text)
wofi --show drun
```

All issues identified have been systematically addressed and integrated into the main OhmArchy installation system. No more "optional" applications being skipped!
