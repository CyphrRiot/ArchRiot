# ArchRiot Development Roadmap

## v2.2.0 ARCHITECTURAL OVERHAUL - IN DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

**CURRENT BRANCH**: `v2.2-yaml-architecture` (DEVELOPMENT - NOT IN MASTER)

### üöÄ MAJOR INITIATIVE: Declarative Package & Configuration System

**Status**: PLANNING & PROTOTYPING - Changes made in isolated branch
**Target**: v2.2.0 major release
**Safety**: All development isolated from stable master branch until fully tested and approved

#### DEVELOPMENT PLAN & NEXT STEPS:

**PHASE 1: YAML Manifest Design** (Current Phase)

- [ ] Design comprehensive YAML schema for packages, configs, and dependencies
- [ ] Create example manifests for core, desktop, applications modules
- [ ] Define dependency resolution logic and validation rules
- [ ] Document migration strategy from current shell script system

**PHASE 2: Core Engine Development**

- [ ] Build YAML parser and validator
- [ ] Implement dependency resolution engine
- [ ] Create unified package installation system
- [ ] Develop configuration template system with proper variable substitution

**PHASE 3: Gradual Module Migration**

- [ ] Convert core modules to YAML format (base, identity, shell)
- [ ] Migrate desktop modules (hyprland, theming, applications)
- [ ] Transform applications modules (productivity, utilities, communication)
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility during transition

**PHASE 4: Testing & Validation**

- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all converted modules
- [ ] Performance comparison with current system
- [ ] Edge case testing and error handling validation
- [ ] User acceptance testing with real installations

**PHASE 5: APPROVAL & MERGE** (REQUIRES EXPLICIT PERMISSION)

- [ ] Final code review and approval
- [ ] Master branch merge ONLY after complete testing and user approval
- [ ] Rollback plan if issues discovered post-merge
- [ ] Documentation updates for new system

#### DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW RULES:

1. **BRANCH ISOLATION**: All v2.2 changes stay in `v2.2-yaml-architecture` branch
2. **NO MASTER CHANGES**: Master branch remains stable with v2.1.7 system
3. **EXPLICIT APPROVAL**: Each phase requires user approval before proceeding
4. **TESTING MANDATORY**: Every component must be tested before phase completion
5. **ROLLBACK READY**: Maintain ability to abandon changes if issues arise

#### ARCHITECTURAL GOALS:

- **90% Code Reduction**: Eliminate repetitive shell scripting across 30+ modules
- **Dependency Management**: Clear, automatic resolution of component dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Single YAML file changes instead of scattered script modifications
- **Reliability**: Consistent error handling, retry logic, and state management
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new packages/configs without script writing

#### RISK MITIGATION:

- Development in isolated branch prevents disruption of working system
- Incremental migration allows testing at each step
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition
- Original system preserved for rollback if needed
- User approval required at every major milestone

## Current Status: v2.1.7 (STABLE)

- Installation system reliability: ‚úÖ Complete
- Theme config nightmare: ‚úÖ ELIMINATED
- Critical installation failures: ‚úÖ FIXED
- Plymouth upgrade protection: ‚úÖ FIXED
- Ivy Bridge Vulkan compatibility: ‚úÖ FIXED
- Process detachment issues: ‚úÖ FIXED
- AMD graphics artifacts: ‚úÖ FIXED

## RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.1.7)

### ‚úÖ install.sh Core Optimizations

**Problem**: Multiple inefficiencies in main installer script
**Solution**: Systematic optimization of core installation logic

- **Eliminated multiple tee operations**: Replaced process spawning with direct file operations
- **Simplified module discovery**: Direct execution approach (49 lines of code eliminated)
- **Centralized hardcoded paths**: All paths defined in configuration section
- **Result**: Faster installation with cleaner, more maintainable code

### ‚úÖ Process Detachment Audit Complete

**Problem**: Orphaned scripts with improper background process handling
**Solution**: Comprehensive cleanup of background process management

- **Removed orphaned waybar.sh**: Script was unused and lacked proper process detachment
- **Verified all critical services**: swaybg, waybar, mako properly detached with nohup & disown
- **Result**: Clean codebase with no improper background process handling

## RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.1.6)

### ‚úÖ AMD Graphics Artifacts Fix

**Problem**: Thunar and other GTK4 applications showing visual artifacts on AMD systems
**Solution**: Progressive fallback graphics configuration system

- **Primary**: `GSK_RENDERER=gl` for stable GL rendering
- **AMD optimizations**: `mesa_glthread=true`, Mesa version overrides
- **Fallback options**: Cairo renderer and software rendering available if needed
- **Result**: Hardware acceleration preserved while eliminating artifacts

### ‚úÖ Process Detachment Audit Complete

**Problem**: Background services disappearing when installer terminal closes
**Solution**: Comprehensive audit and cleanup of background process management

- **Fixed**: All critical services (`swaybg`, `waybar`, `mako`) properly detached with `nohup & disown`
- **Cleaned**: Removed orphaned `waybar.sh` script that lacked proper detachment
- **Result**: All background services persist correctly after installation

## CURRENT DEVELOPMENT FOCUS

### üöÄ ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT: Declarative Package & Configuration System (v2.2 Branch)

**Status**: IN DEVELOPMENT - Fundamental architectural improvement for v2.2.0
**Branch**: `v2.2-yaml-architecture` (isolated from stable master)
**Problem**: Current system has excessive scripting and code duplication across 30+ modules

#### Current Architecture Issues:

- **Repeated Code**: Every script duplicates `install_packages`, error handling, config copying
- **Scattered Package Lists**: Package definitions spread across dozens of separate files
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different error handling and logging approaches
- **No Dependency Management**: Unclear relationships between installation modules
- **Hard to Maintain**: Difficult to see "what gets installed" without reading scripts

#### Proposed Solution: YAML-Based Declarative System

**1. Single Package Manifest** (`install/packages.yaml`):

```yaml
core:
    base:
        packages: [base-devel, git, rsync, bc]
        configs: [environment.d/*, fish/*]
        dependencies: []

desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, fuzzel, mako]
        configs: [hypr/*, waybar/*, fuzzel/*]
        dependencies: [core.base]

applications:
    productivity:
        packages: [zed, btop, fastfetch]
        configs: [zed/*, btop/*]
        dependencies: [desktop.hyprland]
```

**2. Unified Installation Engine**:

- Reads YAML manifest for all package/config definitions
- Automatic dependency resolution with proper ordering
- Consistent error handling and retry logic across all operations
- Template-based configuration deployment
- State tracking to eliminate redundant operations
- Single point of maintenance for all installation logic

#### Expected Benefits:

- **90% Code Reduction**: Eliminate repetitive shell scripting
- **Clear Dependencies**: Visual dependency chains and resolution
- **Easier Maintenance**: Change packages/configs in one centralized location
- **Better Reliability**: Consistent error handling and state management
- **Faster Development**: Add new components by editing YAML, not writing scripts
- **Better Testing**: Test manifest logic instead of scattered scripts

#### Implementation Status:

- ‚úÖ **v2.2.0 Branch Created**: `v2.2-yaml-architecture` active development branch
- üîÑ **Phase 1 Active**: YAML manifest design and planning in progress
- ‚è≥ **Gradual Migration**: Will convert modules one category at a time after approval
- ‚è≥ **Testing Pipeline**: Comprehensive validation planned before any master merge

### üîß Completed File-by-File Optimizations

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - install.sh optimizations successful

- ‚úÖ **install.sh**: All major inefficiencies resolved (3 optimizations applied)
- üîÑ **Remaining files**: Deferred pending architectural decision

## ARCHITECTURAL COMPLETIONS

### ‚úÖ Control Panel Architecture Overhaul (v2.0.18)

- **Eliminated**: Redundant config system conflicts
- **Implemented**: Direct system config management
- **Result**: Settings persist across sessions, no config conflicts

### ‚úÖ

Theme System Optimization (v2.0.16-2.0.17)

- **Eliminated**: Multiple redundant theme operations
- **Implemented**: State tracking and consolidated workflows
- **Result**: Faster installations, cleaner progress indication

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Current Achievement Status
