# ArchRiot Development Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT: YAML ARCHITECTURE TRANSITION (v2.5.0)

**TARGET**: Replace 30+ scattered .sh files with unified YAML-driven installation system
**STATUS**: Planning phase - corrected implementation strategy
**SAFETY**: All development in separate branch until fully tested and approved

### ðŸ“‹ CORRECT YAML PLAN: Actually Eliminate Shell Scripts

#### OBJECTIVE: Replace (not supplement) 30+ .sh files with YAML processing

**CURRENT PROBLEM:**

- 30+ individual installation scripts with duplicated code
- Package lists scattered across dozens of files
- Inconsistent error handling and logging
- Hard to see "what gets installed" without reading scripts
- Maintenance nightmare when adding new packages

**SOLUTION: YAML Processing System**

1. **`install.sh`** - Enhanced with YAML processing capability
2. **`install/packages.yaml`** - All package and config definitions
3. **`install/handlers.sh`** - Only for truly complex operations (GPU detection, etc.)

#### YAML STRUCTURE (packages.yaml):

```yaml
# Complete package definitions replacing individual .sh files
core:
    base:
        packages: [base-devel, git, rsync, bc]
        configs: [environment.d/*, fish/*]
        handler: setup_base_system # Only for yay installation complexity

desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, fuzzel, mako, hyprlock, hypridle]
        configs: [hypr/*, waybar/*, fuzzel/*, mako/*]
        depends: [core.base]

    apps:
        packages: [ghostty, thunar, brave-bin, signal-desktop]
        configs: [ghostty/*, thunar/*]
        depends: [desktop.hyprland]

development:
    tools:
        packages: [zed, btop, fastfetch, tree, wget, curl]
        configs: [zed/*, btop/*]

media:
    players:
        packages: [mpv, lollypop, pavucontrol]
        configs: [mpv/*]
```

#### IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

**PHASE 1: Build YAML Processing Engine**

- [ ] Add YAML parsing capability to `install.sh`
- [ ] Create package installation function that reads YAML
- [ ] Create config copying function that reads YAML
- [ ] Test with one simple module (replace actual .sh file)

**PHASE 2: Create Complete Package Definitions**

- [ ] Map all existing .sh files to YAML definitions
- [ ] Create `install/packages.yaml` with complete system definition
- [ ] Identify what truly needs `handlers.sh` (GPU detection, services)
- [ ] Test YAML processing installs everything correctly

**PHASE 3: Replace Shell Scripts**

- [ ] Switch `install.sh` to use YAML processing instead of calling .sh files
- [ ] Delete replaced .sh files (applications/, development/, media/, etc.)
- [ ] Keep only complex handlers that cannot be represented in YAML
- [ ] Verify complete system works without old .sh files

**PHASE 4: Testing & Approval**

- [ ] Full installation testing (VM + bare metal)
- [ ] Performance validation (should be faster)
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] **EXPLICIT APPROVAL REQUIRED** before master merge

#### BENEFITS:

âœ… **Actual File Reduction**: 30+ files â†’ 2-3 files
âœ… **Real Simplification**: YAML replaces shell scripts, doesn't supplement them
âœ… **Maintainable**: Add packages by editing YAML, not writing shell scripts
âœ… **Clear System View**: See entire installation in one YAML file
âœ… **Preserve Complexity**: Only truly complex operations stay in shell
âœ… **Faster Installation**: Direct YAML processing, no script overhead

#### CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM FAILED APPROACH:

**WRONG**: Create YAML + keep all .sh files (adding complexity)
**RIGHT**: Replace .sh files with YAML processing (reducing complexity)

The goal is REPLACEMENT, not SUPPLEMENTATION.

### ðŸš€ PREPARATION: Understanding Current Architecture for YAML Transition

**Status**: ANALYSIS PHASE - Understanding current system before replacement
**Target**: Map existing .sh files to YAML definitions for v2.5.0 transition
**Goal**: Complete replacement of shell script architecture

#### Current Architecture Analysis:

**File Categories for YAML Migration:**

1. **Simple Package Lists** (Easy YAML conversion):
    - `install/applications/` - Direct package â†’ YAML mapping
    - `install/development/` - Tools and packages â†’ YAML mapping
    - `install/optional/` - Optional packages â†’ YAML mapping
    - Most desktop components â†’ YAML mapping

2. **Complex Logic** (Requires handlers):
    - GPU detection and driver installation
    - Service configuration and startup
    - yay AUR helper installation
    - Hardware-specific configurations

3. **Current Duplicated Patterns** (YAML will eliminate):
    - `install_packages` function calls in every script
    - Config file copying logic repeated everywhere
    - Inconsistent error handling patterns
    - Manual dependency management

#### Analysis Results:

- **~25 files**: Pure package lists â†’ Direct YAML conversion
- **~5 files**: Complex hardware/service logic â†’ Handler functions
- **~90% reduction possible**: Most scripts just install packages + copy configs

#### YAML Processing Requirements:

- Package installation with pacman/yay
- Config file copying with pattern matching
- Dependency resolution and ordering
- Handler function execution for complex operations
- Error handling and rollback capability
- Progress reporting integration

## RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.1.6)

### âœ… AMD Graphics Artifacts Fix

**Problem**: Thunar and other GTK4 applications showing visual artifacts on AMD systems
**Solution**: Progressive fallback graphics configuration system

- **Primary**: `GSK_RENDERER=gl` for stable GL rendering
- **AMD optimizations**: `mesa_glthread=true`, Mesa version overrides
- **Fallback options**: Cairo renderer and software rendering available if needed
- **Result**: Hardware acceleration preserved while eliminating artifacts

### âœ… Process Detachment Audit Complete

**Problem**: Background services disappearing when installer terminal closes
**Solution**: Comprehensive audit and cleanup of background process management
