# ArchRiot Development Roadmap

## 🎯 NEXT: YAML ARCHITECTURE TRANSITION (v2.5.0)

## **IMPORTANT** -- RULES

READ THE RULES. READ THE ROADMAP.

1. Propose ONE SMALL DIRECT CHANGE AT A TIME.

2. IF I AGREE to the change, then make it.

3. After you've made it, wait for me to confirm and review the code and ask "Continue?" and wait for "yes" or further instructions.

4. Test each change!

5. If there is ANY new info, update the ROADMAP so we stay on task and keep up-to-date

6. After each working, tested fix, ask "Commit?"

DO NOT SKIP AHEAD. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS BEHAVIOR.

### PLAN

**TARGET**: Replace 30+ scattered .sh files with unified YAML-driven installation system
**STATUS**: MAJOR PIVOT - Moving from Bash to Go for performance and reliability
**SAFETY**: All development in separate branch until fully tested and approved

### 🔄 CURRENT PROGRESS (v2.5 BRANCH)

**✅ COMPLETED TUI ARCHITECTURE FIXES:**

- ✅ **v2.5 branch created**: Proper tracking for TUI fixes and architecture changes
- ✅ **TUI threading model fixed**: TUI now owns main thread, installation runs in goroutine (no more race conditions)
- ✅ **Responsive terminal sizing implemented**: Width/height calculations based on actual terminal size
- ✅ **Package installation spam removed**: Clean TUI showing only module-level operations, not individual package details
- ✅ **Command output truncation**: Limited to 200 chars to prevent massive dumps
- ✅ **Mirror fixing bullshit eliminated**: Removed hanging reflector commands, graceful pacman sync failure
- ✅ **Screen clearing issues resolved**: Removed WithAltScreen() to preserve output, added proper spacing
- ✅ **Input field system implemented**: Full
  user input handling for git credentials and reboot prompt
- ✅ **Beautiful Tokyo Night TUI**: ASCII art, proper styling, bordered scroll window working

**✅ COMPLETION INTERACTION FIXES:**

- ✅ **Beautiful reboot buttons**: Single-line YES/NO buttons below scroll window with arrow key navigation
- ✅ **Fixed button selection**: Clear visual indication with [►YES◄] and [ NO ] formatting
- ✅ **Proper quit handling**: tea.Quit instead of os.Exit(0) for clean TUI shutdown
- ✅ **No screen replacement**: Content stays visible, buttons appear below scroll window
- ✅ **Responsive layout**: All content fits within terminal bounds without scrolling off
- ✅ **Default to NO**: Safe default selection for reboot prompt

**🎉 TUI COMPLETION SUCCESS:**

- ✅ **Beautiful installation progress**: Tokyo Night themed interface with scroll window
- ✅ **Clean completion interaction**: Reboot prompt with arrow key selection
- ✅ **All content preserved**: Installation log stays visible throughout
- ✅ **Proper exit handling**: Clean shutdown without hanging
- ✅ **Perfect user experience**: Professional TUI matching Migrate quality

**CORE FUNCTIONALITY STATUS:**

- ✅ **Package installation working**: YAML-driven batch installation functional
- ✅ **Config copying working**: Preservation directives and file copying implemented
- ✅ **Module execution working**: Priority-based execution (core→development→desktop→media)
- ✅ **Logging system working**: File-based logging with proper error handling
- ✅ **No hanging commands**: Eliminated mirror fixing, graceful error handling

**🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: MODULAR REFACTORING**

**🎯 CURRENT FOCUS: COMPLETE MODULAR REFACTORING**

**COMPLETED WORK:**

1. **✅ MODULE STRUCTURE DEFINED**: Clean package layout without internal/ nesting
2. **✅ LOGGER MODULE EXTRACTED**: All logging functionality moved to `logger/` package
3. **✅ BEAUTIFUL Y/N SYSTEM**: Replaced complex button/channel system with Migrate's simple cursor pattern
4. **✅ GIT CREDENTIALS FIXED**: Proper reading from git config, beautiful confirmation prompts
5. **✅ LOG FORMATTING STANDARDIZED**: All messages use consistent `%-15s` alignment and emoji spacing
6. **✅ SYSTEM TESTED**: Git credentials flow works correctly with real user data

**NEXT MODULE EXTRACTION PRIORITIES:**

1. **✅ COMPLETED: Create tui/ package** - ✅ Extracted TUI interface (model, view, update, buttons) - All TUI code moved to tui/ package, main.go updated, screen clearing added, standardized logging function created
2. **🔄 NEXT: Create config/ package** - Extract YAML parsing and configuration types
3. **📋 THEN: Create git/ package** - Extract git credential handling
4. **📋 THEN: Create installer/ package** - Extract installation logic
5. **📋 FINALLY: Refactor main.go** - Small coordinator importing modules (target: 50 lines)

**AFTER MODULAR REFACTORING:**

1. **Shell Script Analysis**: Resume systematic analysis of remaining .sh files for YAML migration
2. **YAML Completion**: Add missing modules (system, applications, optional) based on shell script patterns
3. **Handler Functions**: Implement complex logic that can't be represented in YAML
4. **Final Binary**: Complete transition to single `archriot-install` binary + `packages.yaml`

**CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED:**

- ✅ **ALWAYS TEST FIRST**: External testing prevented major integration failures
- ✅ **COPY WORKING PATTERNS**: Migrate's simple cursor approach > complex custom systems
- ❌ **DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE**: Channels and async messaging caused hanging issues
- ❌ **WATCH SYSTEM CHANGES**: Accidentally overwrote user's git config during testing
- ✅ **FOLLOW THE RULES**: One change at a time prevents debugging nightmares
- ✅ **CONSISTENT FORMATTING**: Emoji alignment and spacing matter for professional appearance
- ✅ **MODULAR LOGGING**: Created sendFormattedLog() function for consistent message formatting
- ✅ **GIT CREDENTIAL FIX**: Fixed broken git YES/NO confirmation using callback system
- ✅ **LOG ALIGNMENT**: Fixed misaligned completion messages by using sendFormattedLog consistently

**ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS:**

- **Go Benefits Confirmed**: Native YAML, static typing, compiled performance, beautiful TUI
- **Modular Design Works**: Logger extraction successful, more modules needed
- **Simple > Complex**: Migrate's cursor pattern beats custom button/channel systems
- **Test Everything**: Global changes (git config) can have unexpected consequences

### 📋 CORRECT YAML PLAN: Actually Eliminate Shell Scripts

#### OBJECTIVE: Replace (not supplement) 30+ .sh files with YAML processing

**Current Reality Check:**

- We have 30+ shell scripts doing repetitive package installation + config copying
- Most scripts follow identical patterns with different package lists
- YAML can handle 90% of this with proper structure and handlers
- Go installer can process YAML natively without external dependencies
- Result: Single compiled binary replaces entire shell script ecosystem

#### YAML STRUCTURE (packages.yaml):

```yaml
core:
    base:
        packages: [list]
        configs: [pattern-based copying]
        handler: special_logic_function
    identity:
        packages: [list]
        configs: [pattern-based copying]
        depends: [core.base]

desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [list]
        configs: [pattern-based copying]
        depends: [core.base]
    apps:
        packages: [list]
        configs: [pattern-based copying]
        depends: [desktop.hyprland]

development:
    tools:
        packages: [list]
        configs: [pattern-based copying]

media:
    players:
        packages: [list]
        configs: [pattern-based copying]
```

#### IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETE

#### BENEFITS:

- **90% code reduction**: Replace 30+ shell scripts with single YAML file + handlers
- **Parallel execution**: Concurrent package installation with goroutines
- **Better error handling**: Proper error types and recovery
- **No external dependencies**: Single compiled binary, no bash/gum/yq needed
- **Consistent patterns**: All modules follow same YAML structure

- Core YAML processing: ✅ COMPLETE
- Git credentials input: 🔄 NEXT PRIORITY
- Shell script analysis:
  📋 ONGOING
- Handler functions: 📋 IN PROGRESS
- Full YAML migration: 📋 PLANNED

### 🚀 PREPARATION: Understanding Current Architecture for YAML Transition

**Status**: Architecture analysis complete, proceeding with systematic YAML migration

**Goal**: Complete replacement of shell script architecture

#### Current Architecture Analysis:

**File Categories for YAML Migration:**

1. **Simple Package Lists** (Easy YAML conversion):
    - `install/applications/` - Direct package → YAML mapping
    - `install/development/` - Tools and packages → YAML mapping
    - `install/optional/` - Optional packages → YAML mapping
    - Most desktop components → YAML mapping

2. **Complex Logic** (Requires handlers):
    - GPU detection and driver installation
    - Service configuration and startup
    - yay AUR helper installation
    - Hardware-specific configurations

3. **Current Duplicated Patterns** (YAML will eliminate):
    - `install_packages` function calls in every script
    - Config file copying logic repeated everywhere
    - Inconsistent error handling patterns
    - Manual dependency management

#### YAML Processing Requirements:

- Package installation with pacman/yay
- Config file copying with pattern matching
- Dependency resolution and ordering
- Handler function execution for complex operations
- Error handling and rollback capability
- Progress reporting integration
