# ArchRiot Development Roadmap

## v2.2.0 SIMPLIFIED MODULE SYSTEM - IN DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

**CURRENT BRANCH**: `v2.2-yaml-architecture` (DEVELOPMENT - NOT IN MASTER)

### 🚀 MAJOR INITIATIVE: Brilliant Simplified Approach

**Status**: IMPLEMENTATION - Ultra-simple solution preserving all existing functionality
**Target**: v2.2.0 major release
**Safety**: All development isolated from stable master branch until fully tested and approved

#### THE BRILLIANT SIMPLE SOLUTION:

**Keep install.sh exactly as-is, eliminate 25+ scattered files with just:**

- `install.sh` (unchanged - all existing logic preserved)
- `install/modules.yaml` (simple: packages + configs + dependencies)
- `install/complex-modules.sh` (only for tricky logic that needs shell scripting)

#### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

**PHASE 1: Create Simple Structure** (Current Phase)

- [x] Delete all overengineered files from previous attempt
- [x] Create simple modules.yaml with package lists and config paths
- [x] Create modules.sh for hardware detection, services, etc.
- [ ] Add 5-10 lines to install.sh to read YAML for simple modules

**PHASE 2: Migration**

- [ ] Move simple modules (packages + configs only) to modules.yaml
- [ ] Move complex logic (GPU detection, yay install, services) to complex-modules.sh
- [ ] Remove 25+ individual .sh files
- [ ] Test that everything still works exactly the same

**PHASE 3: Testing & Validation**

- [ ] Verify all existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Test fallback if YAML reading fails
- [ ] Performance validation (should be faster)
- [ ] User acceptance testing

**PHASE 4: APPROVAL & MERGE** (REQUIRES EXPLICIT PERMISSION)

- [ ] Final code review and approval
- [ ] Master branch merge ONLY after complete testing and user approval
- [ ] Documentation updates

#### ARCHITECTURE:

**modules.yaml handles:**

- Package lists (pacman + AUR)
- Config file copying paths
- Simple dependencies

**modules.sh handles:**

- GPU detection and driver installation
- Service configuration and enablement
- yay AUR helper installation
- Hardware-specific logic
- Anything requiring shell scripting

**install.sh:**

- Unchanged existing logic
- Reads modules.yaml for simple stuff
- Calls modules.sh for complex stuff
- Full backward compatibility

#### BENEFITS:

- **90% Code Reduction**: Eliminate 25+ scattered .sh files
- **Zero Risk**: install.sh remains unchanged
- **Easy Maintenance**: Simple modules centralized in YAML
- **Preserve Complexity**: Complex logic stays in shell where it belongs
- **Minimal Changes**: <10 lines added to install.sh

#### RISK MITIGATION:

- install.sh functionality completely preserved
- Complex logic remains in proven shell scripts
- Simple fallback if YAML fails
- All existing workflows unchanged
- Gradual migration with testing at each step

## Current Status: v2.1.7 (STABLE)

- Installation system reliability: ✅ Complete
- Theme config nightmare: ✅ ELIMINATED
- Critical installation failures: ✅ FIXED
- Plymouth upgrade protection: ✅ FIXED
- Ivy Bridge Vulkan compatibility: ✅ FIXED
- Process detachment issues: ✅ FIXED
- AMD graphics artifacts: ✅ FIXED

## RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.1.7)

### ✅ install.sh Core Optimizations

**Problem**: Multiple inefficiencies in main installer script
**Solution**: Systematic optimization of core installation logic

- **Eliminated multiple tee operations**: Replaced process spawning with direct file operations
- **Simplified module discovery**: Direct execution approach (49 lines of code eliminated)
- **Centralized hardcoded paths**: All paths defined in configuration section
- **Result**: Faster installation with cleaner, more maintainable code

### ✅ Process Detachment Audit Complete

**Problem**: Orphaned scripts with improper background process handling
**Solution**: Comprehensive cleanup of background process management

- **Removed orphaned waybar.sh**: Script was unused and lacked proper process detachment
- **Verified all critical services**: swaybg, waybar, mako properly detached with nohup & disown
- **Result**: Clean codebase with no improper background process handling

## RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.1.6)

### ✅ AMD Graphics Artifacts Fix

**Problem**: Thunar and other GTK4 applications showing visual artifacts on AMD systems
**Solution**: Progressive fallback graphics configuration system

- **Primary**: `GSK_RENDERER=gl` for stable GL rendering
- **AMD optimizations**: `mesa_glthread=true`, Mesa version overrides
- **Fallback options**: Cairo renderer and software rendering available if needed
- **Result**: Hardware acceleration preserved while eliminating artifacts

### ✅ Process Detachment Audit Complete

**Problem**: Background services disappearing when installer terminal closes
**Solution**: Comprehensive audit and cleanup of background process management

- **Fixed**: All critical services (`swaybg`, `waybar`, `mako`) properly detached with `nohup & disown`
- **Cleaned**: Removed orphaned `waybar.sh` script that lacked proper detachment
- **Result**: All background services persist correctly after installation

## CURRENT DEVELOPMENT FOCUS

### 🚀 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT: Declarative Package & Configuration System (v2.2 Branch)

**Status**: IN DEVELOPMENT - Fundamental architectural improvement for v2.2.0
**Branch**: `v2.2-yaml-architecture` (isolated from stable master)
**Problem**: Current system has excessive scripting and code duplication across 30+ modules

#### Current Architecture Issues:

- **Repeated Code**: Every script duplicates `install_packages`, error handling, config copying
- **Scattered Package Lists**: Package definitions spread across dozens of separate files
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different error handling and logging approaches
- **No Dependency Management**: Unclear relationships between installation modules
- **Hard to Maintain**: Difficult to see "what gets installed" without reading scripts

#### Proposed Solution: YAML-Based Declarative System

**1. Single Package Manifest** (`install/packages.yaml`):

```yaml
core:
    base:
        packages: [base-devel, git, rsync, bc]
        configs: [environment.d/*, fish/*]
        dependencies: []

desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, fuzzel, mako]
        configs: [hypr/*, waybar/*, fuzzel/*]
        dependencies: [core.base]

applications:
    productivity:
        packages: [zed, btop, fastfetch]
        configs: [zed/*, btop/*]
        dependencies: [desktop.hyprland]
```

**2. Unified Installation Engine**:

- Reads YAML manifest for all package/config definitions
- Automatic dependency resolution with proper ordering
- Consistent error handling and retry logic across all operations
- Template-based configuration deployment
- State tracking to eliminate redundant operations
- Single point of maintenance for all installation logic

#### Expected Benefits:

- **90% Code Reduction**: Eliminate repetitive shell scripting
- **Clear Dependencies**: Visual dependency chains and resolution
- **Easier Maintenance**: Change packages/configs in one centralized location
- **Better Reliability**: Consistent error handling and state management
- **Faster Development**: Add new components by editing YAML, not writing scripts
- **Better Testing**: Test manifest logic instead of scattered scripts

#### Implementation Status:

- ✅ **v2.2.0 Branch Created**: `v2.2-yaml-architecture` active development branch
- 🔄 **Phase 1 Active**: YAML manifest design and planning in progress
- ⏳ **Gradual Migration**: Will convert modules one category at a time after approval
- ⏳ **Testing Pipeline**: Comprehensive validation planned before any master merge

### 🔧 Completed File-by-File Optimizations

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - install.sh optimizations successful

- ✅ **install.sh**: All major inefficiencies resolved (3 optimizations applied)
- 🔄 **Remaining files**: Deferred pending architectural decision

## ARCHITECTURAL COMPLETIONS
