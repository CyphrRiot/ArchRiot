# ArchRiot Development Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT: YAML ARCHITECTURE TRANSITION (v2.3.0)

**TARGET**: Major simplification of installation system while preserving 100% functionality
**STATUS**: Planning phase - clear implementation strategy defined
**SAFETY**: All development in separate branch until fully tested and approved

### ðŸ“‹ YAML PLAN: Crystal Clear Implementation Strategy

#### OBJECTIVE: Eliminate 30+ scattered .sh files while keeping install.sh unchanged

**CURRENT PROBLEM:**

- 30+ individual installation scripts with duplicated code
- Package lists scattered across dozens of files
- Inconsistent error handling and logging
- Hard to see "what gets installed" without reading scripts
- Maintenance nightmare when adding new packages

**SOLUTION: Three-File Architecture**

1. **`install.sh`** - UNCHANGED (all existing logic preserved)
2. **`install/packages.yaml`** - Simple package + config definitions
3. **`install/complex.sh`** - Only complex logic requiring shell scripting

#### YAML STRUCTURE (packages.yaml):

```yaml
# Simple, clear package definitions
core:
    base:
        packages: [base-devel, git, rsync, bc]
        configs: [environment.d/*, fish/*]

    yay:
        # Complex logic stays in complex.sh
        handler: "install_yay_aur_helper"

desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, fuzzel, mako, hyprlock, hypridle]
        configs: [hypr/*, waybar/*, fuzzel/*, mako/*]
        depends: [core.base]

    apps:
        packages: [ghostty, thunar, brave-bin, signal-desktop]
        configs: [ghostty/*, thunar/*]
        depends: [desktop.hyprland]

development:
    tools:
        packages: [zed, btop, fastfetch, tree, wget, curl]
        configs: [zed/*, btop/*]

    migrate:
        # Complex download logic stays in complex.sh
        handler: "install_migrate_tool"

media:
    players:
        packages: [mpv, lollypop, pavucontrol]
        configs: [mpv/*]
```

#### IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

**PHASE 1: Create Foundation**

- [ ] Create `install/packages.yaml` with core package definitions
- [ ] Create `install/complex.sh` for GPU detection, yay install, etc.
- [ ] Add 10 lines to `install.sh` to read YAML for simple modules
- [ ] Test that basic packages install correctly

**PHASE 2: Migrate Simple Modules**

- [ ] Move all "packages + configs only" from .sh files to YAML
- [ ] Applications, media, productivity, utilities â†’ YAML
- [ ] Keep complex logic (GPU detection, services) in complex.sh
- [ ] Test each migration step

**PHASE 3: Remove Old Files**

- [ ] Delete 25+ individual .sh files that are now in YAML
- [ ] Update directory structure
- [ ] Verify nothing broken

**PHASE 4: Testing & Approval**

- [ ] Full installation testing (VM + bare metal)
- [ ] Performance validation (should be faster)
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] **EXPLICIT APPROVAL REQUIRED** before master merge

#### BENEFITS:

âœ… **90% Code Reduction**: 30+ files â†’ 3 files
âœ… **Zero Risk**: install.sh logic completely unchanged
âœ… **Easy Maintenance**: Add packages by editing YAML, not shell scripts
âœ… **Clear Overview**: See entire system in one YAML file
âœ… **Preserve Complexity**: GPU detection, services stay in proven shell code
âœ… **Faster Installation**: No script parsing overhead for simple operations

#### SAFETY MEASURES:

- install.sh core logic remains 100% unchanged
- Complex hardware detection stays in shell scripts where it belongs
- Fallback to old system if YAML parsing fails
- All development in isolated branch until approved
- Gradual migration with testing at each step
- **NO MERGE TO MASTER** without explicit approval

---

### ðŸš€ ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT: Declarative Package & Configuration System (v2.2 Branch)

**Status**: IN DEVELOPMENT - Fundamental architectural improvement for v2.2.0
**Branch**: `v2.2-yaml-architecture` (isolated from stable master)
**Problem**: Current system has excessive scripting and code duplication across 30+ modules

#### Current Architecture Issues:

- **Repeated Code**: Every script duplicates `install_packages`, error handling, config copying
- **Scattered Package Lists**: Package definitions spread across dozens of separate files
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different error handling and logging approaches
- **No Dependency Management**: Unclear relationships between installation modules
- **Hard to Maintain**: Difficult to see "what gets installed" without reading scripts

#### Proposed Solution: YAML-Based Declarative System

**1. Single Package Manifest** (`install/packages.yaml`):

```yaml
core:
    base:
        packages: [base-devel, git, rsync, bc]
        configs: [environment.d/*, fish/*]
        dependencies: []

desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, fuzzel, mako]
        configs: [hypr/*, waybar/*, fuzzel/*]
        dependencies: [core.base]

applications:
    productivity:
        packages: [zed, btop, fastfetch]
        configs: [zed/*, btop/*]
        dependencies: [desktop.hyprland]
```

**2. Unified Installation Engine**:

- Reads YAML manifest for all package/config definitions
- Automatic dependency resolution with proper ordering
- Consistent error handling and retry logic across all operations
- Template-based configuration deployment
- State tracking to eliminate redundant operations
- Single point of maintenance for all installation logic

#### Expected Benefits:

- **90% Code Reduction**: Eliminate repetitive shell scripting
- **Clear Dependencies**: Visual dependency chains and resolution
- **Easier Maintenance**: Change packages/configs in one centralized location
- **Better Reliability**: Consistent error handling and state management
- **Faster Development**: Add new components by editing YAML, not writing scripts
- **Better Testing**: Test manifest logic instead of scattered scripts

## RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.2.0)

### âœ… VM Environment Compatibility

**Problem**: Installation failures in VM environments due to missing repositories and interactive prompts
**Solution**: Automatic repository configuration and non-interactive fallbacks

- **Auto-enabled multilib repository**: Detects and configures missing multilib support automatically
- **Database synchronization**: Added pacman -Sy before all package installations
- **Non-interactive GPU detection**: Eliminates hanging prompts with software fallback for VMs
- **Result**: Seamless installation in VM environments without user intervention

### âœ… Progress Display System Fixes

- **Result**: Clean, readable progress display throughout installation

## RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.1.9)

### âœ… install.sh Core Optimizations

**Problem**: Multiple inefficiencies in main installer script
**Solution**: Systematic optimization of core installation logic

- **Simplified module discovery**: Direct execution approach (49 lines of code eliminated)
- **Centralized hardcoded paths**: All paths defined in configuration section
- **Result**: Faster installation with cleaner, more maintainable code

### âœ… Process Detachment Audit Complete

**Problem**: Orphaned scripts with improper background process handling
**Solution**: Comprehensive cleanup of background process management

- **Removed orphaned waybar.sh**: Script was unused and lacked proper process detachment
- **Verified all critical services**: swaybg, waybar, mako properly detached with nohup & disown
- **Result**: Clean codebase with no improper background process handling

## RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.1.6)

### âœ… AMD Graphics Artifacts Fix

**Problem**: Thunar and other GTK4 applications showing visual artifacts on AMD systems
**Solution**: Progressive fallback graphics configuration system

- **Primary**: `GSK_RENDERER=gl` for stable GL rendering
- **AMD optimizations**: `mesa_glthread=true`, Mesa version overrides
- **Fallback options**: Cairo renderer and software rendering available if needed
- **Result**: Hardware acceleration preserved while eliminating artifacts

### âœ… Process Detachment Audit Complete

**Problem**: Background services disappearing when installer terminal closes
**Solution**: Comprehensive audit and cleanup of background process management

- **Fixed**: All critical services (`swaybg`, `waybar`, `mako`) properly detached with `nohup & disown`
- **Cleaned**: Removed orphaned `waybar.sh` script that lacked proper detachment
- **Result**: All background services persist correctly after installation

### ðŸ”§ Completed File-by-File Optimizations
