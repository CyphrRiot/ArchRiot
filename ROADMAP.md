# ArchRiot Development Roadmap

## üéØ NEXT: YAML ARCHITECTURE TRANSITION (v2.5.0)

## **IMPORTANT** -- RULES

READ THE RULES. READ THE ROADMAP.

1. Propose ONE SMALL DIRECT CHANGE AT A TIME.

2. IF I AGREE to the change, then make it.

3. After you've made it, wait for me to confirm and review the code and ask "Continue?" and wait for "yes" or further instructions.

4. Test each change!

5. If there is ANY new info, update the ROADMAP so we stay on task and keep up-to-date

DO NOT SKIP AHEAD. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS BEHAVIOR.

### PLAN

**TARGET**: Replace 30+ scattered .sh files with unified YAML-driven installation system
**STATUS**: MAJOR PIVOT - Moving from Bash to Go for performance and reliability

- ‚úÖ **Screen replacement vs append**: Never replace entire screen, always append to bottom

**FINDINGS FROM SHELL SCRIPT ANALYSIS:**

**Pattern Analysis (core/01-base.sh):**

- Complex error handling and validation logic
- Mirror fixing functionality
- yay installation with fallback methods
- Package installation with dependency verification
- Critical vs non-critical failure handling
- PATH management and binary verification

**Key Insights:**

- Not just package lists - complex logic that needs handler functions
- Error recovery and system repair capabilities
- Interactive vs automated installation modes
- Dependency verification beyond package manager

**BASH LIMITATIONS DISCOVERED:**

- No native YAML support - requires external `yq` dependency
- Terrible data structures - arrays are clunky, no objects/maps
- String processing hell - parsing structured data is painful

- Sequential processing - no concurrency for package installs
- Type system issues - everything is strings, easy mistakes

**GO INSTALLER BENEFITS:**

- ‚úÖ **Single compiled binary** - no runtime dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Parallel package installs** - goroutines for concurrent operations
- ‚úÖ **Built-in YAML support** - native parsing without external tools
- ‚úÖ **Static typing** - catch errors at compile time
- ‚úÖ **Superior error handling** - proper error types and propagation
- ‚úÖ **Fast execution** - compiled performance vs interpreted bash
- ‚úÖ **No external UI dependencies** - native Go UI instead of gum
- ‚úÖ **Beautiful UI potential** - bubbletea/lipgloss for professional terminal interface

**NEXT STEPS (v2.5):**

1. **Git Credentials**: Implement username/email input prompts during core.identity module execution
2. **Shell Script Analysis**: Resume systematic analysis of install/core/04-shell.sh and remaining scripts
3. **YAML Completion**: Add missing modules (system, applications, optional) based on shell script analysis
4. **Handler Functions**: Implement complex logic discovered in shell scripts that can't be represented in YAML
5. **Version Management**: Update VERSION to 2.5.0 and prepare for merge to main
6. **Documentation**: Update INSTALLER.md with new TUI features and usage
7. **Testing**: Full end-to-end testing on clean system before release

**üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA ACHIEVED:**

### üìã CORRECT YAML PLAN: Actually Eliminate Shell Scripts

#### OBJECTIVE: Replace (not supplement) 30+ .sh files with YAML processing

**CURRENT PROBLEM:**

- 30+ individual installation scripts with duplicated code
- Package lists scattered across dozens of files
- Inconsistent error handling and logging
- Hard to see "what gets installed" without reading scripts
- Maintenance nightmare when adding new packages

**SOLUTION: YAML Processing System**

1. **`install.sh`** - Enhanced with YAML processing capability
2. **`install/packages.yaml`** - All package and config definitions
3. **`install/handlers.sh`** - Only for truly complex operations (GPU detection, etc.)

#### YAML STRUCTURE (packages.yaml):

```yaml
# Complete package definitions replacing individual .sh files
core:
    base:
        packages: [base-devel, git, rsync, bc]
        configs: [environment.d/*, fish/*]
        handler: setup_base_system # Only for yay installation complexity

desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, fuzzel, mako, hyprlock, hypridle]
        configs: [hypr/*, waybar/*, fuzzel/*, mako/*]
        depends: [core.base]

    apps:
        packages: [ghostty, thunar, brave-bin, signal-desktop]
        configs: [ghostty/*, thunar/*]
        depends: [desktop.hyprland]

development:
    tools:
        packages: [zed, btop, fastfetch, tree, wget, curl]
        configs: [zed/*, btop/*]

media:
    players:
        packages: [mpv, lollypop, pavucontrol]
        configs: [mpv/*]
```

- [x] Create test YAML file with real package definitions
- [x] Test YAML engine with core.base module on live system
- [x] Validate all functions work correctly with real package manager calls
- [x] **PIVOT DECISION**: Move from Bash to Go for superior architecture

**PHASE 2: Go Installer Development**

- [x] Build minimal Go installer binary

- [‚úÖ] **Direct console output removed**: All fmt.Printf/Println calls eliminated from main.go
- [‚ùå] **CRITICAL BUG**: TUI display corruption, terminal sizing issues, output artifacts persist
- [ ] **CURRENT**: Debug and fix fundamental TUI display problems
- [ ] Resume systematic analysis of install/core/04-shell.sh and remaining scripts
- [ ] Map shell script functionality to Go functions and YAML definitions
- [ ] Add missing modules and handlers based on analysis
- [ ] Fix TUI properly after core functionality complete

**PHASE 2.5: Complete Package Definitions**

- [ ] **ACTIVE**: Systematically analyze each .sh file to understand complete workflows
    - [ ] install/core/\*.sh (3 files) - Base system, identity, shell
    - [ ] install/system/\*.sh - System configuration
    - [ ] install/desktop/\*.sh - Desktop environment components
    - [ ] install/applications/\*.sh - Application installations
    - [ ] install/development/\*.sh - Development tools
    - [ ] install/optional/\*.sh - Optional components
    - [ ] install/post-desktop/\*.sh - Post-desktop configuration
    - [ ] Standalone files: plymouth.sh, printer.sh, mimetypes.sh, asdcontrol.sh
- [ ] Map all existing .sh files to YAML definitions + Go handler functions
- [ ] Expand `install/packages.yaml` with complete system definition
- [ ] Create Go functions for complex logic (mirror fixing, GPU detection, service management)
- [ ] Test complete Go installer handles all installation scenarios correctly

**PHASE 3: Replace Shell Scripts**

- [ ] Replace `install.sh` with compiled Go binary
- [ ] Update `setup.sh` to download and run Go installer
- [ ] Delete replaced .sh files (applications/, development/, media/, etc.)
- [ ] Keep only complex handlers as Go functions within binary
- [ ] Verify complete system works faster and more reliably than shell scripts

**PHASE 4: Testing & Approval**

- [ ] Full installation testing (VM + bare metal)
- [ ] Performance validation (should be faster)
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] **EXPLICIT APPROVAL REQUIRED** before master merge

#### BENEFITS:

‚úÖ **Actual File Reduction**: 30+ files ‚Üí 1 binary + 1 YAML file
‚úÖ **Real Simplification**: YAML + Go replaces shell scripts entirely
‚úÖ **Maintainable**: Add packages by editing YAML, not writing shell scripts
‚úÖ **Clear System View**: See entire installation in one YAML file
‚úÖ **Preserve Complexity**: Complex operations as Go functions in binary
‚úÖ **Much Faster Installation**: Compiled binary with concurrent package installs
‚úÖ **Superior Reliability**: Static typing and proper error handling
‚úÖ **Zero Dependencies**: Single binary, no runtime requirements

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM FAILED APPROACH:**

**WRONG**: Create YAML + keep all .sh files (adding complexity)
**RIGHT**: Replace .sh files with Go binary + YAML (reducing complexity)

The goal is REPLACEMENT, not SUPPLEMENTATION.

**REALITY CHECK FROM ANALYSIS:**

- Shell scripts contain complex logic beyond package installation
- Go functions will handle: mirror fixing, yay installation, GPU detection, service management
- YAML will handle: package lists, config file patterns, module dependencies
- Result: 1 compiled Go binary + 1 YAML file instead of 30+ shell scripts

**WHY GO IS SUPERIOR:**

- **Performance**: Compiled binary vs interpreted shell scripts
- **Concurrency**: Batch package installation avoiding database locks
- **Reliability**: Static typing catches errors before runtime
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure vs bash spaghetti
- **Distribution**: Single binary vs complex script dependencies
- **UI Independence**: Tokyo Night color theme implemented (TUI needs fixing)
- **Config Intelligence**: Sophisticated config preservation logic
- **Git Integration**: Automatic Git configuration from environment files
- **Mirror Management**: Automatic mirror fixing when database sync fails
- **Professional Appearance**: Will implement proper TUI after core functionality complete

### üöÄ PREPARATION: Understanding Current Architecture for YAML Transition

**Status**: ANALYSIS PHASE - Understanding current system before replacement
**Target**: Map existing .sh files to YAML definitions for v2.5.0 transition
**Goal**: Complete replacement of shell script architecture

#### Current Architecture Analysis:

**File Categories for YAML Migration:**

1. **Simple Package Lists** (Easy YAML conversion):
    - `install/applications/` - Direct package ‚Üí YAML mapping
    - `install/development/` - Tools and packages ‚Üí YAML mapping
    - `install/optional/` - Optional packages ‚Üí YAML mapping
    - Most desktop components ‚Üí YAML mapping

2. **Complex Logic** (Requires handlers):
    - GPU detection and driver installation
    - Service configuration and startup
    - yay AUR helper installation
    - Hardware-specific configurations

3. **Current Duplicated Patterns** (YAML will eliminate):
    - `install_packages` function calls in every script
    - Config file copying logic repeated everywhere
    - Inconsistent error handling patterns
    - Manual dependency management

#### Analysis Results:

- **~25 files**: Pure package lists ‚Üí Direct YAML conversion
- **~5 files**: Complex hardware/service logic ‚Üí Handler functions
- **~90% reduction possible**: Most scripts just install packages + copy configs

#### YAML Processing Requirements:

- Package installation with pacman/yay
- Config file copying with pattern matching
- Dependency resolution and ordering
- Handler function execution for complex operations
- Error handling and rollback capability
- Progress reporting integration
