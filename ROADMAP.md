# ArchRiot Development Roadmap

## Current Status: v2.0.1

- Installation system reliability: ‚úÖ Complete
- Theme config nightmare: ‚úÖ ELIMINATED
- Critical installation failures: ‚úÖ FIXED
- Waybar update notifications: ‚úÖ Simplified and working
- Upgrade path compatibility: ‚úÖ Fixed for v2.0.0+ transition

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 1. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Theme Config Nightmare ELIMINATED

**Status**: COMPLETED in v2.0.0-2.0.1 - Theme system completely redesigned
**Problem**: Theme configs completely override main config instead of extending it
**Impact**: Every new feature must be manually added to every theme config or it disappears

**COMPLETED WORK**:

#### Phase 1: Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Mapped all files being overridden by theme system
- ‚úÖ Identified scope of theme config replacements

#### Phase 2: File Consolidation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Copied CypherRiot configs to replace main configs (waybar, fuzzel, mako, btop)
- ‚úÖ Moved CypherRiot backgrounds to main backgrounds directory
- ‚úÖ Moved CypherRiot ghostty.conf to main config
- ‚úÖ Merged CypherRiot hyprland.conf styling into main config
- ‚úÖ Moved CypherRiot text-editor themes to main config

#### Phase 3: Theme System Removal ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Removed tokyo-night theme directory completely
- ‚úÖ Removed cypherriot theme directory
- ‚úÖ Removed theme linking logic from `install/desktop/theming.sh`
- ‚úÖ Removed theme symlink creation (`~/.config/archriot/current/theme`)
- ‚úÖ Updated hyprlock.conf to use direct CypherRiot config

#### Phase 4: Installer Updates ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Removed `setup_archriot_theme_system()` function
- ‚úÖ Removed `set_default_theme()` function
- ‚úÖ Removed `link_theme_configs()` function
- ‚úÖ Removed `link_waybar_config()` function
- ‚úÖ Simplified theming.sh to only handle cursors, icons, GTK themes
- ‚úÖ Tested installation with simplified theme system

#### Phase 5: Documentation & Testing ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Updated README.md to remove theme selection instructions
- ‚úÖ Updated INSTALLER.md to remove theme system warnings
- ‚úÖ Tested all applications work with consolidated configs
- ‚úÖ Verified waybar update notifications work
- ‚úÖ Tested lock screen functionality
- ‚úÖ Tested fuzzel launcher functionality

#### v2.0.1 Upgrade Path Fixes ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Added missing backgrounds directory to repository
- ‚úÖ Fixed hyprlock.conf upgrade detection and automatic replacement
- ‚úÖ Fixed background service startup after upgrade
- ‚úÖ Verified upgrade path works for v1.9.x ‚Üí v2.0.1

### 2. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Critical Installation Failures FIXED

**Status**: COMPLETED in v2.0.0-2.0.1 - All critical failures resolved
**Problem**: Multiple critical installation failures discovered during testing
**Impact**: Users cannot complete installation due to broken components

**FIXED ISSUES**:

- ‚úÖ **Migrate tool download**: Fixed "text file busy" error with temp file approach and process killing
- ‚úÖ **PipeWire audio system**: Fixed dependency conflicts with proper conflict detection and removal
- ‚úÖ **Local variable errors**: Fixed all `local` declarations outside functions
- ‚úÖ **Audio system**: Complete audio stack now installs properly (pavucontrol, pamixer, playerctl)
- ‚úÖ **Waybar update notifications**: Eliminated complex caching system, direct version comparison works
- ‚úÖ **Background system**: Fixed upgrade path, backgrounds install and display correctly
- ‚úÖ **Lock screen**: Fixed hyprlock.conf transition from theme sourcing to consolidated config

### 3. üîß Fix Fuzzel Sudo Integration

**Status**: High Priority - Affects core user experience
**Problem**: Migrate command works in terminal but fails in Fuzzel launcher
**Impact**: Users cannot access migration tool from application launcher

**Actions**:

- [ ] Implement pkexec wrapper for migrate command
- [ ] Create GUI sudo helper for privileged operations
- [ ] Update desktop integration files
- [ ] Test fuzzel integration with sudo commands
- [ ] Verify migrate tool launches from application menu

### 4. üìä Implement Modern Progress Bar System

**Status**: FUTURE ENHANCEMENT - Clean installer experience
**Problem**: Current installer output is verbose and overwhelming
**Impact**: Users can't see actual progress through installation noise

**Desired Experience**:

**Static progress bar**: Stays in place, updates percentage in real-time
**Module names**: Show friendly names ("Desktop Environment" not "install/desktop/apps.sh")
**Background logging**: All verbose output goes to log files
**Error surfacing**: Only show actual errors on console, not warnings
**Clean completion**: Beautiful summary at end

**Implementation Plan**:

- [ ] Create progress bar UI system (similar to migrate tool)
- [ ] Map technical modules to user-friendly names
- [ ] Redirect all package manager output to log files
- [ ] Implement error vs warning detection
- [ ] Add real-time percentage calculation based on module completion
- [ ] Test that errors still surface properly while maintaining clean UI
- [ ] Preserve all reliability improvements from v1.9.0+

**Success Criteria**:

- Beautiful, clean console output during installation
- All verbose logs written to files in background
- Real errors immediately visible to user
- Progress bar shows actual completion percentage
- User can see what's happening without noise

### 5. üöÄ System-wide v2.0.1 Deployment

**Status**: Medium Priority - Production rollout
**Problem**: Ensure all systems get latest fixes and improvements
**Impact**: Users need v2.0.1 fixes for proper upgrade path

**Actions**:

- [ ] Deploy v2.0.1 to all production systems
- [ ] Verify upgrade path works properly (v1.9.x ‚Üí v2.0.1)
- [ ] Monitor for edge cases or regressions
- [ ] Collect user feedback on theme consolidation
- [ ] Verify background and lock screen functionality after upgrades
- [ ] Document any deployment issues

### 6. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Theme System Verification

**Status**: COMPLETED in v2.0.1 - Quality assurance passed
**Problem**: Need to verify theme consolidation doesn't break functionality
**Impact**: Ensure simplified theme system maintains all features

**COMPLETED VERIFICATION**:

- ‚úÖ Tested waybar theming with unified config
- ‚úÖ Verified lock screen themes work correctly
- ‚úÖ Checked desktop theming elements
- ‚úÖ Validated all color schemes and styling
- ‚úÖ Updated theme documentation
- ‚úÖ Tested upgrade path from v1.9.x systems
- ‚úÖ Verified background system works after upgrade
- ‚úÖ Confirmed update notifications appear properly

## NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE

### Short-term Goals (Next 2 weeks)

- ‚úÖ Complete theme system consolidation (DONE in v2.0.1)
- Fix fuzzel sudo integration
- Restore clean installer with progress bars
- Deploy v2.0.1 everywhere

### Medium-term Goals (Next month)

- Enhanced verification system
- Performance optimization
- Better error recovery tools
- Improved user onboarding
- Cross-platform installer testing

### Long-term Vision (Next quarter)

- Automated updates system
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Cross-distribution support
- Advanced customization options

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Theme System Success ‚úÖ ACHIEVED

- ‚úÖ Single unified theme config (no more overrides)
- ‚úÖ No feature loss when adding new capabilities
- ‚úÖ All theming functionality preserved (CypherRiot integrated)
- ‚úÖ Massive maintenance overhead reduction (eliminated 1000+ lines of theme code)
- ‚úÖ Upgrade path works correctly
- ‚úÖ Background and lock screen function properly

### Installation Experience Success ‚úÖ PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Progress bars need restoration (currently verbose output)
- ‚úÖ All errors immediately visible (no more silent failures)
- ‚úÖ Critical installation failures resolved
- ‚úÖ User feedback positive for reliability improvements

### Integration Success ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Migrate tool launches from Fuzzel (needs pkexec wrapper)
- ‚úÖ Desktop integration is seamless
- ‚úÖ Update notifications work reliably
- ‚úÖ Background cycling and management works

## NOTES

**Critical Learning**: Theme overrides are a maintenance nightmare. The discovery that theme configs completely replace main configs rather than extending them explains why features like update notifications disappeared. This must be the #1 priority to prevent future silent failures.

**Deployment Strategy**: v1.9.2 fixes are critical for production systems. Theme notification functionality is essential for user experience.

**Development Approach**: One focused change per iteration, always ask "Continue?" before modifications, never commit without explicit permission.
