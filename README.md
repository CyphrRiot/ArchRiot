## **ArchRiot: The (Arch) Linux System You've Always Wanted**

**One Command. Complete Environment. Zero Compromises.**

ArchRiot is the answer to every time you've thought "why can't Linux just work correctly from the start?" We've spent hundreds of hours perfecting the details so you get a blazing-fast, secure, beautiful system that actually respects your time and intelligence.

**Curated to be correct:**

- **ü™ü Hyprland Tiling WM** - Makes other Window Managers feel primitive
- **‚ö° Go Binary Installer** - Atomic operations, instant rollbacks, zero dependency hell
- **üõ°Ô∏è Privacy by Design** - Zero telemetry, zero tracking, zero corporate data harvesting
- **üé® CypherRiot Aesthetics** - Carefully crafted dark themes that work at any hour
- **üíª Development-First** - Zed, Neovim, shell enhancements, and other upgrades

_Built on Arch Linux with Hyprland, because compromises are for other people. This isn't maintained by committee or corporate roadmap -- it's maintained by someone with an obsessive, singular focus on getting it right the first time, because crappy Linux environments are an insult to what computing should be._

_Keep your ArchRiot system running like a well-oiled machine_

```bash
archriot                             # ArchRiot's intelligent installer/upgrade engine
                                     # Automatically detects if upgrade is needed
                                     # Prompts for confirmation before proceeding

migrate                              # Backup/restore wizard - your insurance policy
sudo systemctl reboot                # Fresh start - sometimes you need it
sudo systemctl poweroff              # Graceful shutdown - not a crash
```

### üéµ Audio & Media

_Hardware media keys that actually work - imagine that!_

```bash
XF86AudioRaiseVolume                 # Volume up - with gorgeous overlay
XF86AudioLowerVolume                 # Volume down - smooth as silk
XF86AudioMute                        # Toggle mute - instant feedback
XF86AudioMicMute                     # Microphone toggle - privacy at a keystroke
XF86AudioPlay/Pause                  # Media control - works with everything

# Beautiful volume overlay appears instantly with progress bar
# These are your actual hardware keys working the way they should
```

### üìä Waybar Controls (Status Bar)

_Your desktop's mission control - everything you need at a glance_

```bash
Click tomato timer                   # Pomodoro focus mode - stay productive
Double-click tomato timer            # Reset to 25:00 - fresh start
Click network icon                   # Network manager - connect anywhere
Click volume icon                    # Audio settings - fine-tune your sound
Click battery icon                   # Power management - stay charged
```

### Lid/Idle policy (laptops, docked vs undocked)

- Docked (external display connected): closing the lid does not suspend; system does not idle-suspend.
- Undocked: closing the lid suspends; idle suspend occurs at 30 minutes by default.

Implemented via:

- `/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/10-docked-ignore-lid.conf`:
    - `HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore`, `HandleLidSwitch=suspend`, `HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=suspend`
- `/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/20-idle-ignore.conf`:
    - `IdleAction=ignore` (logind does not idle-suspend)
- hypridle:
    - 10 min: `on-timeout = lock` (reliable hyprlock trigger)
    - 30 min: `on-timeout = ~/.local/bin/suspend-if-undocked.sh` (suspends only when undocked)
- kanshi autostart (hotplug profiles) for dock/undock screen management

Note: We never restart systemd-logind during install/upgrade; drop-ins take effect after reboot or a manual restart you perform later.

## üéØ Key Customizations

### üîß **Core System Changes**

- **Terminal:** Ghostty (replaces Kitty) with 90% transparency and dark theme
- **Browser:** Brave (replaces Chromium) with native Wayland support
- **File Manager:** Thunar (replaces Nautilus) with comprehensive dark theming
- **Shell:** Fish as default (replaces Bash) with proper PATH configuration
- **Theme:** CypherRiot integrated as unified theme system
- **Code Editor:** Zed (Wayland) + Neovim with proper theme integration
- **Applications:** All major apps now run native Wayland (no more XWayland issues)

- **DPI Scaling:** Fixed scaling issues for consistent UI across all applications

#### üß† **Memory Management Fix**

Linux's default memory management is **aggressively stupid** about caching. The kernel will happily consume 90%+ of your RAM for file caches, then struggle to free it when applications actually need memory.

**ArchRiot's Solution:** Comprehensive memory management tuning that provides:

**Core Improvements:**

- **Smart Caching** - Reserves 1GB RAM, reduces aggressive file system caching
- **Minimal Swapping** - 10% swappiness (vs 60% default) keeps everything in RAM
- **Lag-Free Writing** - 5% dirty page limit prevents massive write bursts
- **Background Cleanup** - 2% background writeback for smooth performance

**Advanced Protection:**

- **Memory Overcommit Control** - Prevents dangerous memory allocation that causes crashes
- **Proactive Defragmentation** - Reduces memory fragmentation for better allocation
- **Smart OOM Killer** - Kills problematic processes, not random system services
- **Enhanced Responsiveness** - Optimized dirty page intervals and memory bandwidth

**Real-World Impact:**

- **No more lag spikes** when opening applications or switching windows
- **Better responsiveness** under heavy memory pressure (tested with 75%+ RAM usage)
- **Reduced swap usage** with intelligent RAM utilization
- **System stability** under extreme load - no freezes or crashes

**Result:** Your system stays fast and responsive even when running multiple applications, compiling code, or under extreme stress testing.

### üì± **Advanced Waybar Integration**

ArchRiot includes a highly customized Waybar (status bar) with comprehensive system integration:

**Built-in Modules:**

- **üçÖ Tomato Timer** - Built-in Pomodoro timer (idle/running/break/finished)

## üîÑ System Management

### Updates

**System Updates:**

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu                     # Standard Arch Linux system update
yay -Syu                             # Update AUR packages
```

**ArchRiot Updates:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archriot.org/setup.sh | bash    # Update ArchRiot (same as install)
```

**Automatic Update Notifications**: ArchRiot automatically checks for updates every 4 hours and shows a notification dialog when newer versions are available. You can install updates, ignore notifications, or simply close the dialog.

Update dialog options:

- Install from cURL ‚Äî uses the maintainer‚Äôs install/packages.yaml (may reintroduce packages you previously removed).
- Install from Local ‚Äî uses your local ~/.local/share/archriot/install/packages.yaml and respects packages you‚Äôve removed.

When to choose which:

- Local: you‚Äôve removed packages you don‚Äôt want reintroduced, you‚Äôve customized modules locally, or you want the safest upgrade that preserves your current set.
- cURL: you want to align to the maintainer‚Äôs latest package set, you‚Äôre repairing a broken local state, or you prefer the canonical defaults after larger changes.

Extras:

- View Diff ‚Äî shows a unified diff between your local packages.yaml and the maintainer‚Äôs, so you can preview changes before upgrading.
- Local safety check ‚Äî a smoke test runs before ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù upgrades and will block if it detects packages that would be reintroduced. You can optionally allowlist specific packages via ~/.config/archriot/upgrade-allowlist.txt.
- Bluesky (optional) ‚Äî The Bluesky PWA is not installed by default. To enable it:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
    cp ~/.local/share/archriot/config/applications/xtras/Bluesky.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
    update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
    ```

    It will then appear in Fuzzel as "Bluesky."

Brave wrapper and per-user flags

- Launchers: Only two visible entries: Brave and Brave (Private). The internal archriot-brave.desktop is hidden and used for default browser mapping; it won‚Äôt appear in launchers.
- Wrapper: The archriot-brave launcher enforces Wayland when available and enables GPU rasterization by default for stability and performance.
- Per-user overrides: Create ~/.config/archriot/brave-flags.conf (one flag per line) to add or override flags. Examples:
  --disable-gpu
  --ozone-platform=x11
- Precedence: Command-line args > brave-flags.conf > built-in defaults. Duplicate flags are resolved by key (higher precedence wins).
- PATH: The wrapper is also available at ~/.local/bin/archriot-brave for consistent shell access.
- Defaults applied automatically (when on Wayland):
  --ozone-platform=wayland
  --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform
  --enable-gpu-rasterization

<div align="center">
<img src="config/images/upgrade.png" alt="ArchRiot Update Dialog" width="600">
<br><em>Waybar update notifications: Û∞ö∞ (new), Û±ßò (seen), - (up-to-date) with one-click upgrade dialog</em>
</div>

The ArchRiot updater downloads the latest YAML configuration and pre-built binary, then intelligently applies only the changes needed. The YAML-based system ensures **atomic updates** with proper dependency resolution - no partial failures or broken states like traditional shell script updaters.

### Portals and Screencast Troubleshooting

- Confirm active portals:
    - systemctl --user status xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland
    - ps aux | grep xdg-desktop-portal
- Verify preferred portal selection:
    - Check ~/.config/xdg-desktop-portal/portals.conf (or /etc/xdg-desktop-portal/portals.conf)
    - Ensure default=hyprland;gtk; and hyprland is selected for ScreenCast/Screenshot/Clipboard
- Reset portals (fix stale processes):
    - systemctl --user restart xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland
    - If needed: pkill xdg-desktop-portal; pkill xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland; then restart the services
- Quick screencast tests:
    - Kooha: kooha (record a short clip). You should see a Wayland screencast prompt and successful capture on clean installs.
    - OBS Studio: In Sources, click + and ensure "Screen Capture (PipeWire)" is available. Select it and verify monitor/window capture works. If missing, restart portals (see above) or relaunch your Hyprland session.
- Common issues and fixes:
    - Make sure xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland is installed and up to date
    - Avoid conflicting portals; ensure hyprland is first in the default list
    - If prompts do not appear, restart the user session or relaunch Hyprland

### Waybar Portability Troubleshooting

- Reload without duplicates:
    - Send a config reload: archriot --waybar-reload (sends SIGUSR2; auto-restarts Waybar on crash)
    - If the bar is unresponsive, restart cleanly: killall waybar; archriot --waybar-launch
- Check single-instance status and logs:
    - Status: archriot --waybar-status
    - Logs: tail -n 200 ~/.cache/archriot/runtime.log
- Idle/Lock screen not triggering? See "Hypridle: Lock Not Triggering (exec syntax)" below
- Dynamic detection tips:
    - Network: modules/scripts should auto-detect active interfaces; ensure your interface is up (ip link), and NetworkManager is running if you rely on it
    - Temperature: scripts try coretemp/k10temp/zenpower first, then thermal zones; install lm_sensors and run sensors-detect if temps are missing
    - Battery: laptop-only; verify /sys/class/power_supply/BAT\* exists
- Common fixes:
    - After theme/config changes, prefer SIGUSR2 reloads (pkill -SIGUSR2 waybar) over full restarts for stability
    - If modules look stale, restart portals (see Portals Troubleshooting) and then Waybar
    - Validate your configs exist under ~/.config/waybar and that custom scripts are executable

### WiFi drops on lock/idle

If your WiFi drops when the screen locks or during idle:

1. Quick diagnostic (read-only)

- Run:

```/dev/null/commands.sh#L1-3
~/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --wifi-powersave-check
```

- This prints:
    - NetworkManager drop-in status: expects wifi.powersave=2 at /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/40-wifi-powersave.conf
    - Runtime power save on your wireless interface (e.g., wlan0): expects power_save off

2. Fix NetworkManager drop-in (persistent)

- If the drop-in is missing or not set to 2:

```/dev/null/commands.sh#L1-2
echo -e "[connection]\nwifi.powersave=2" | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/40-wifi-powersave.conf
sudo systemctl reload NetworkManager
```

3. Turn off runtime WiFi power save (temporary)

- If the diagnostic shows ‚Äúpower_save on‚Äù for your interface:

```/dev/null/commands.sh#L1-1
sudo iw dev <iface> set power_save off
```

- Replace <iface> with your wireless interface (e.g., wlan0). This helps avoid WiFi power saving while the session is locked.

4. Re-run the check

- Verify both the drop-in and runtime state:

```/dev/null/commands.sh#L1-1
~/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --wifi-powersave-check
```

### Backup & Restore

```bash
migrate
```

**üéØ Migrate** is a separate project by Cypher Riot that gets automatically installed during ArchRiot setup. It's a TUI (Text User Interface) with **no command-line options**. Simply run the command and use the interactive menu to:

- Create comprehensive system backups
- Restore from previous backups
- Migrate configurations between installations
- Preserve all your customizations

**Integration Details:** ArchRiot automatically downloads and installs the latest version of Migrate from [CypherRiot/Migrate](https://github.com/CyphrRiot/Migrate) during installation, ensuring you always have the most current backup capabilities without any manual setup.

## üé® CypherRiot Theme System

There is one theme: **CypherRiot**, a beautiful Neo Tokyo Dark inspired theme. If you don't like it, the theme files are at `~/.local/share/archriot/config/` and can be edited.

**Visual Design:**

- **Style:** Custom Neo Tokyo Dark aesthetic with dark elegance
- **Color Palette:** Deep purples, electric blues, and charcoal backgrounds
- **Integration:** Complete system theming (waybar, hyprlock, fuzzel, terminals, applications)
- **Backgrounds:** 23 riot-themed wallpapers for dynamic cycling

**System Integration:**

- **Window Manager:** CypherRiot colors in Hyprland decorations and borders
- **Status Bar:** Custom waybar with CypherRiot purple accents and consistent styling
- **Lock Screen:** Beautiful hyprlock with CypherRiot theme and system status
- **Applications:** Unified theming across GTK, terminal, and desktop applications

### Wallpaper Management

- **Instant application:** Background changes apply immediately
- **Persistent settings:** Background preferences survive reboots and updates

**Background System:**

- **CypherRiot collection:** 23 riot-themed wallpapers included
- **Easy cycling:** Use `SUPER + CTRL + SPACE` to cycle through backgrounds
- **Dynamic switching:** Script-based background rotation for variety
- **High quality:** Curated wallpapers optimized for the CypherRiot aesthetic

**Advanced Customization:**

- **Background location:** `~/.local/share/archriot/backgrounds/` (consolidated directory)
- **Custom backgrounds:** Add your own wallpapers to the backgrounds directory
- **Script integration:** Background cycling integrates with waybar and system status
- **Application consistency:** CypherRiot theme provides unified styling across all applications

## Understanding the YAML Configuration

**For developers and power users who want to customize the system before installation:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyphrRiot/ArchRiot.git ~/.local/share/archriot
# Edit install/packages.yaml to customize
~/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot
```

### YAML Architecture

ArchRiot uses a modern YAML-based configuration system that replaces traditional shell scripts. The entire system is defined in `install/packages.yaml`, which contains:

**Structure:**

- **Categories** (core, desktop, development, system, media)
- **Modules** within each category (base, hyprland, tools, etc.)
- **Each module defines:**
    - `packages:` - List of packages to install
    - `configs:` - Configuration files to deploy with patterns and targets
    - `commands:` - Post-installation commands to run
    - `depends:` - Dependencies on other modules
    - `type:` - Installation type (pacman, yay, flatpak, etc.)

**Example module:**

```yaml
desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, wofi, hyprpaper]
        configs:
            - pattern: "config/hypr/*"
              target: "~/.config/hypr/"
              preserve_if_exists: [monitors.conf]
            - pattern: "config/waybar/*"
              target: "~/.config/waybar/"
        commands: ["systemctl --user enable hyprland"]
        depends: [core.base]
        type: pacman
```

This YAML system provides clean separation of packages, configurations, and commands while maintaining full dependency resolution and proper installation ordering.

### Configuration Preservation

ArchRiot includes an intelligent preservation system via `install/preserve.yaml` that maintains your personal customizations during upgrades and reinstalls. This ensures your keyboard layout, application preferences, and other settings survive system updates.

**Preserved Settings:**

- **Keyboard Configuration** - Layout (us, fr, de), variant, and model
- **Default Applications** - Browser, terminal, file manager, and dock preferences
- **User Customizations** - Any settings you've modified in Hyprland configs

**How It Works:**

1. **Detection** - Scans existing configs for user-customizable settings
2. **Backup** - Creates timestamped backups in `~/.cache/archriot/`
3. **Extraction** - Pulls out your personal settings using defined patterns
4. **Restoration** - Optionally applies saved settings to new configs

**Example preserve.yaml entry:**

```yaml
user_customizable_settings:
    - name: "kb_layout"
      description: "Keyboard layout (us, fr, de, etc.)"
      pattern: "kb_layout"

    - name: "browser"
      description: "Default browser application"
      pattern: "$browser"
```

The system prompts during installation: **"Restore your hyprland modifications?"** allowing you to choose whether to apply your saved preferences to the fresh configuration.

## ‚ö° ArchRiot At a Glance

- **Advanced Waybar integration** - Custom modules, Pomodoro timer, VPN status, system monitoring
- **Modern application stack** - Ghostty terminal, Brave browser, native Wayland applications
- **Intelligent system tuning** - Memory management fixes, blue light filtering, DPI scaling

ArchRiot transforms Omarchy from a general productivity setup into a specialized development and privacy-focused environment.

## üîç Installation Verification System

ArchRiot includes a comprehensive verification system to ensure everything is working correctly:

### What the Installer Actually Does

The ArchRiot installer validates everything automatically as it runs. You don't need separate validation because the installer IS the validation system:

**Real-time validation during installation:**

- YAML configuration integrity and module dependencies
- Essential packages (yay, git, base-devel)
- Desktop environment (Hyprland, Waybar, fuzzel, mako)
- Configuration file deployment verification
- Applications (terminal, file manager, browser, text editor)
- System services (audio, network, bluetooth)
- Network connectivity and repository accessibility
- Memory, disk space, and system requirements

**If anything fails:** The installer stops immediately with clear error messages and diagnostic information. Fix the issue and re-run - it's completely safe and idempotent.

- **Detailed failure analysis** with specific recommendations
- **Fix suggestions** for failed components

### Verification

Installation logs are in `~/.cache/archriot/install.log` and can be reviewed for the full installation details or any errors during the installation process.

### Expected Defaults

After fresh installation, you should see:

- **Default theme:** CypherRiot (Neo Tokyo Dark aesthetic)
- **Default background:** riot_zero.png (riot-themed wallpaper)
- **PDF files:** Show proper document icons (not thumbnails)
- **Image files:** Show thumbnail previews in Thunar
- **Waybar:** Running with tomato timer, system stats, and transparent microphone button

## ArchRiot CLI Flags

See Advanced Usage: CLI Flags for the complete list and details.

[Jump to Advanced Usage: CLI Flags](#advanced-usage-archriot-cli-flags)

## Hyprland binds and exec-once (examples)

- Exec-once (Waybar):
    - exec-once = $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-launch
- Reload (Waybar):
    - bind = $mod SHIFT, SPACE, exec, $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-reload
- Wallet:
    - bind = $mod, R, exec, $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --wallet
- Pomodoro:
    - bind = $mod, comma, exec, $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --pomodoro-click

## Bluesky (optional; opt-in only)

- Bluesky is not installed by default and does not appear in Fuzzel on a clean install.
- If a previous install left a desktop entry behind, the installer now removes it from:
    - `~/.local/share/applications/`, `/usr/local/share/applications/`, `/usr/share/applications/` (both Bluesky.desktop/bluesky.desktop)
    - Then refreshes the desktop database.

Enable Bluesky (opt-in):

```bash
cp ~/.local/share/archriot/config/applications/xtras/Bluesky.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

<a id="advanced-usage-archriot-cli-flags"></a>

## üß∞ Advanced Usage: CLI Flags

These first-class CLI flags replace legacy helper scripts and are used directly in Hyprland keybinds. All of them execute the built binary at:
$HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot

- --waybar-launch
    - Purpose: Single-instance launcher with non-blocking lock and robust logging.
    - Behavior: Ensures exactly one Waybar instance; writes logs to ~/.cache/archriot/runtime.log.
    - Example (Hyprland exec-once): exec-once = $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-launch

- --waybar-reload
    - Purpose: Robust Waybar reload. Uses SIGUSR2 when possible; fallback to controlled restart.
    - Behavior: Dedupe PIDs and avoid duplicate Waybar after reloads/resume.
    - Example (default bind): SUPER+SHIFT+SPACE ‚Üí archriot --waybar-reload

- --wallet
    - Purpose: Focus-or-launch the configured wallet; avoids duplicate instances.
    - Example (default bind): SUPER+R ‚Üí archriot --wallet

- --pomodoro-click
    - Purpose: Simulate a click on the Waybar tomato timer (toggle/reset via module behavior).
    - Example (default bind): SUPER+, ‚Üí archriot --pomodoro-click

- --upgrade-smoketest
    - Purpose: Local upgrade smoketest used by the update dialog.
    - Exit codes: 0 OK; 2 potential reintroductions; 3 unavailable. Honor allowlist at ~/.config/archriot/upgrade-allowlist.txt

- --stay-awake
    - Purpose: Prevent system suspend while a task runs; always detaches so your app isn't tied to the launcher.
    - Usage:
        - archriot --stay-awake curl -L -o file.iso https://example.com/file.iso
        - archriot --stay-awake
    - Notes: Uses systemd-inhibit to block sleep; does not affect screen lock.

- --volume
    - Purpose: Unified audio control for speakers and microphone across PipeWire/PulseAudio.
    - Backend priority: wpctl (PipeWire with starred sink/source) ‚Üí pamixer ‚Üí pactl
    - Usage:
        - archriot --volume toggle # Toggle speaker mute
        - archriot --volume inc # Increase volume 5%
        - archriot --volume dec # Decrease volume 5%
        - archriot --volume get # Get current volume percentage

### Hypridle: Lock Not Triggering (exec syntax)

Symptoms:

- Screen never locks after idle timeout, but `hyprlock` works when launched manually.
- Hypridle verbose logs show attempts to run `exec, /usr/bin/hyprlock` and errors like `exec,: command not found`.

Cause:

- Hyprland config style (`exec, ...`) was mistakenly used inside hypridle.conf.
- Hypridle expects either `lock` (uses `lock_cmd`) or a direct executable path. It does not interpret `exec,`.

Fix:

1. In `~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf`, replace:

```ini
on-timeout = exec, /usr/bin/hyprlock
```

with either:

```ini
on-timeout = lock
```

or (explicit path):

```ini
on-timeout = /usr/bin/hyprlock
```

2. Use absolute paths in `general {}` and listeners to avoid PATH/env issues under Hyprland:

```ini
general {
  lock_cmd = /usr/bin/hyprlock
  before_sleep_cmd = /usr/bin/loginctl lock-session
  after_sleep_cmd = /usr/bin/hyprctl dispatch dpms on
}
```

3. Restart hypridle:

```bash
pkill hypridle
hyprctl dispatch exec hypridle
```

Notes:

- Waybar‚Äôs `idle_inhibitor` module can block idle. Ensure it‚Äôs not activated if locks don‚Äôt trigger.
- Brightness dim at 5 minutes won‚Äôt affect external HDMI/DP displays; consider adding DPMS off/on at lock for a visible cue on external monitors.

- Troubleshooting:
    - Check backend: wpctl status | head -30
    - Test manually: archriot --volume get
    - Waybar uses this for all volume controls (scroll, click, microphone)

- --brightness
    - Purpose: Backlight control for laptop displays.
    - Usage:
        - archriot --brightness up # Increase brightness
        - archriot --brightness down # Decrease brightness
    - Notes: Uses brightnessctl; integrates with Waybar backlight module scroll actions

- --startup-background
    - Purpose: Start wallpaper at login from saved preferences; avoids theme apply during boot to prevent races.
    - Behavior: Reads ~/.config/archriot/background-prefs.json (key: current_background), falls back to riot_01.jpg or the first available image under ~/.local/share/archriot/backgrounds, writes the state file at ~/.config/archriot/.current-background, and restarts swaybg detached.
    - Example (Hyprland exec-once): exec-once = $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --startup-background

- --swaybg-next
    - Purpose: Cycle to the next wallpaper and refresh theming if dynamic theming is enabled.
    - Behavior: Iterates images in ~/.local/share/archriot/backgrounds, updates ~/.config/archriot/.current-background, restarts swaybg detached, and triggers best-effort theme refresh.
    - Example (default bind): SUPER+CTRL+SPACE ‚Üí $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --swaybg-next

- --waybar-workspace-click
    - Purpose: Safe Waybar workspace click handler (numeric-only).
    - Usage: $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-workspace-click {name}
    - Notes: Validates numeric workspace and dispatches: hyprctl dispatch workspace {name}
    - Example (Waybar ModulesWorkspaces): "on-click": "$HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-workspace-click {name} "

- --waybar-cpu
    - Purpose: Aggregate CPU usage meter for Waybar.
    - Behavior: Reads /proc/stat deltas; renders a bar, percentage, and class via JSON.
    - Example (Waybar): "exec": "$HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-cpu"

- --waybar-temp
    - Purpose: CPU temperature meter for Waybar.
    - Behavior: Autodetects sensor (hwmon coretemp/k10temp/zenpower ‚Üí temp1_input; x86_pkg_temp thermal zone; thermal_zone0 fallback), renders bar and class via JSON.
    - Example (Waybar): "exec": "$HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-temp"

- --waybar-volume
    - Purpose: Speaker volume meter for Waybar.
    - Backend priority: wpctl (PipeWire) ‚Üí pamixer ‚Üí pactl. Renders bar and icon via JSON; shows ‚Äúaudio not ready‚Äù gracefully.
    - Example (Waybar): "exec": "$HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-volume"

- --waybar-memory
    - Purpose: Memory usage meter for Waybar.
    - Behavior: Computes traditional percentage, shows modern vs traditional in tooltip; renders bar and class via JSON.
    - Example (Waybar): "exec": "$HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --waybar-memory"

- --stabilize-session
    - Purpose: Session recovery utility. Dedupe Waybar and relaunch a single, managed instance; restart hypridle to ensure idle/lock policy is active.
    - Usage:
        - archriot --stabilize-session
        - archriot --stabilize-session --inhibit # starts a detached sleep inhibitor for long-running work

- --zed
    - Purpose: Focus-or-launch Zed (native > Flatpak) with Wayland-friendly environment; focuses an existing window if present.
    - Example (bind): SUPER+Z ‚Üí $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --zed
    - Example (desktop entry Exec): $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --zed %U

- --welcome
    - Purpose: Launch the ArchRiot Welcome window (Python GTK) in a detached manner.
    - Example (Hyprland exec-once): sleep 2 && $HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --welcome

## Brave Wrapper and Handler Mapping

ArchRiot routes all browser launches through a PATH-resolved wrapper: `archriot-brave`.

- Executable resolution:
    - The installer ensures the wrapper is on PATH.
    - Any stale `/usr/local/bin/archriot-brave` is proactively removed during install/upgrade to avoid shadowing.

- Defaults and overrides:
    - Defaults enable Wayland/Ozone and GPU rasterization.
    - User flags file: `~/.config/archriot/brave-flags.conf`
    - Flag precedence: CLI flags > user flags file > wrapper defaults
    - Example (user flags file; one flag per line):
      --ozone-platform-hint=wayland
      --enable-gpu-rasterization

- Verify GPU acceleration:
    - Open: `brave://gpu`
    - Expectation: Most features show ‚ÄúHardware accelerated.‚Äù
    - If debugging issues, you can temporarily launch with a safe mode:
      archriot-brave --disable-gpu
    - Crash on workspace/monitor switch: test with the safe mode above. If stable, keep `--disable-gpu` temporarily and verify GPU drivers (Mesa/NVIDIA) and Wayland flags; report your GPU/driver combo.

- Handler policy and verification:
    - HTTP/HTTPS should resolve to the wrapper via the Brave desktop entry.
    - Verify current defaults:
      xdg-settings get default-web-browser
      xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/http
      xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/https
    - Expected: ArchRiot‚Äôs wrapper desktop entry is the default (`archriot-brave.desktop`). Only ‚ÄúBrave‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrave (Private)‚Äù should appear as visible handlers in common menus.

Notes:

- This wrapper approach avoids `$HOME` expansion pitfalls and keeps a consistent Wayland configuration by default.
- Use CLI flags for one-off tests; prefer the user flags file for persistent changes.

## Waybar: Logs, Reloads, and Debugging

See:

- üß∞ Advanced Usage: CLI Flags ‚Äî waybar commands (launch/reload/status)
- üîß Troubleshooting ‚Äî logs path, SIGUSR2 reloads, dedupe tips, and recovery steps

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Multi‚Äëmonitor anomalies after install (ABI mismatch)

If you see display glitches or crashes on multi‚Äëmonitor setups immediately after an install or upgrade, it‚Äôs likely a partial‚Äëupgrade ABI mismatch (e.g., Hyprland/wlroots/portals not in sync). Fix by fully upgrading first, then run the installer again:

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring && yay -Syu && yay -Yc && sudo paccache -r
```

Pro tip: run the installer with `--strict-abi` to block installation until compositor/Wayland updates are applied.

### Installer Sync Recovery (pacman db lock / mirrors)

If you see pacman errors like ‚Äúcould not lock database‚Äù or ‚Äúfailed to synchronize,‚Äù try these steps:

Symptoms:

- could not lock database (db.lck present)
- failed to synchronize packages / failed retrieving file
- temporary failure in name resolution

Steps:

1. Ensure no other package manager is running (pacman/yay/paru).
2. Clear stale lock (safe if no pacman is running):
   sudo rm -f /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
3. Refresh databases:
   sudo pacman -Sy
    # If issues persist, force a full refresh:
    sudo pacman -Syy
4. Retry your install/upgrade and watch for transient mirror/network hiccups.

### Preflight Audit (read-only)

- Run: `~/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot --preflight`
- What it checks (no changes made; safe to run anytime):
    - Config: validates `packages.yaml`
    - Binary path: confirms you‚Äôre using `$HOME/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot`
    - Hyprland binds: verifies `SUPER+G` (Telegram) and `SUPER+S` (Signal)
    - Exec-once: ensures Waybar uses `archriot --waybar-launch`
    - Memory tuning: shows opt-in status (does not modify kernel settings)
    - Waybar: shows instance count (does not kill any process); logs at ~/.cache/archriot/runtime.log

### Memory Tuning (Opt-in)

- By default, ArchRiot does not change kernel memory settings during install/upgrade.
- To enable memory optimizations, create the file: ~/.config/archriot/enable-memory-optimizations and rerun the updater.

#### Apply now (opt-in)

- sudo cp ~/.local/share/archriot/config/system/99-memory-optimization.conf /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf
- total_kb=$(awk "/MemTotal/ {print $2}" /proc/meminfo); calc=$(awk -v t="$total_kb" 'BEGIN {m=int(t*0.01); if (m > 262144) m=262144; print m}'); sudo sed -i "s/^vm.min_free_kbytes=.*/vm.min_free_kbytes=$calc/" /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf
- sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf

#### Revert quickly (if anything feels off)

- sudo sed -i 's/^vm.overcommit*memory=.*/vm.overcommit*memory=0/; s/^vm.overcommit_ratio=.*/vm.overcommit_ratio=50/; s/^vm.min_free_kbytes=.\*/vm.min_free_kbytes=262144/' /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf
- sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf

Notes:

- These settings use kernel heuristics (overcommit=0) and a conservative free-memory reserve to avoid fork/exec starvation.
- Waybar and other helpers should not see ‚ÄúCannot allocate memory‚Äù with these defaults. If you ever do, revert with the above commands and report the scenario.

### Memory Tuning (Opt-in)

By default, ArchRiot does not change kernel memory settings during install/upgrade. To enable memory optimizations, create the flag file and re-run the updater:

```bash
touch ~/.config/archriot/enable-memory-optimizations
```

Apply now (opt-in):

```bash
sudo cp ~/.local/share/archriot/config/system/99-memory-optimization.conf /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf
total_kb=$(awk '/MemTotal/ {print $2}' /proc/meminfo); calc=$(awk -v t="$total_kb" 'BEGIN {m=int(t*0.01); if (m > 262144) m=262144; print m}'); sudo sed -i "s/^vm.min_free_kbytes=.*/vm.min_free_kbytes=$calc/" /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf
```

Revert quickly (if anything feels off):

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^vm.overcommit*memory=.*/vm.overcommit*memory=0/; s/^vm.overcommit_ratio=.*/vm.overcommit_ratio=50/; s/^vm.min_free_kbytes=.*/vm.min_free_kbytes=262144/' /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-optimization.conf
```

### Blinking Cursor Instead of Hyprland

If your system boots to a **blinking cursor** instead of starting Hyprland:

1. **Get to a terminal:** Press `CTRL+ALT+F3`
2. **Login** with your username and password
3. **Re-run the installer** to fix GPU/graphics issues:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://ArchRiot.org/setup.sh | bash
    ```
4. **Reboot** after the script completes

This issue is almost always GPU-related and the installer will detect and fix graphics driver problems automatically.

### ISO Wi‚ÄëFi Troubleshooting (Mediatek MT7921K)

Live fix without rebuilding the ISO. Apply in this order:

- Enable iwd and avoid conflicts:
  sudo systemctl enable --now iwd
  sudo systemctl mask wpa_supplicant

- Unblock radio:
  rfkill list
  sudo rfkill unblock all

- Reload Mediatek driver with ASPM disabled (stability fix):
  sudo modprobe -r mt7921e
  sudo modprobe mt7921e disable_aspm=1
  If the module refuses to unload, disconnect the interface first (via iwctl), then retry.

- Check for missing firmware:
  dmesg | grep -i firmware
  If you see missing Mediatek firmware messages:
    - On an installed system with network:
      sudo pacman -Syu linux-firmware
      sudo modprobe -r mt7921e && sudo modprobe mt7921e disable_aspm=1
    - On live ISO without network:
      Copy required Mediatek firmware files to /lib/firmware/mediatek from another machine/USB, then reload the module.

- Connect using iwd (iwctl):
  iwctl
  device list
  station {device} scan
  station {device} get-networks
  station {device} connect {network}
  station {device} show
  exit

- Persist after install (recommended):
  Create /etc/modprobe.d/mt7921e.conf with:
  options mt7921e disable_aspm=1

- Verify:
    - PCIe device bound to mt7921e:
      lspci -k | grep -A3 -i 7921
    - Radio unblocked:
      rfkill list
    - Link visible/connected:
      iw dev

### Prevent Idle Sleep and Keep Downloads Active

If your system still sleeps after ~10 minutes and interrupts downloads, ensure idle suspend is disabled at logind and that Hypridle isn‚Äôt triggering suspend earlier than expected.

1. Verify logind idle policy (no idle suspend)

- Confirm the ArchRiot drop-in exists and disables idle action:

```bash
cat /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/20-idle-ignore.conf
# Expect:
# [Login]
# IdleAction=ignore
```

- Check effective settings:

```bash
loginctl show-logind -p IdleAction -p IdleActionUSec
# Expect: IdleAction=ignore
```

- If missing, create the drop-in (requires reboot to take effect):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d
printf "[Login]\nIdleAction=ignore\n" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/20-idle-ignore.conf
# Reboot to apply, or be aware that restarting logind can disrupt your session:
# sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```

2. Hypridle behavior (lock vs suspend)

- ArchRiot‚Äôs intended defaults:
    - Lock at 10 minutes
    - Suspend at 30 minutes, only when undocked (via suspend-if-undocked.sh)
- Check if Hypridle is running:

```bash
pgrep -a hypridle || echo "hypridle not running"
```

- Temporarily stop Hypridle (for testing):

```bash
pkill hypridle
```

- If you want to keep downloads going (no auto-suspend):
    - Edit your Hypridle config (commonly at ~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf) to remove or comment the suspend on-timeout action that calls suspend-if-undocked.sh.
    - Keep the 10-minute lock action if desired; remove only the suspend action.

3. Make suspend opt-in during long downloads (inhibitor)

- Use a one-off sleep inhibitor while running a download:

```bash
systemd-inhibit --what=sleep --why="Active download" your-download-command-here
```

- Or keep the session awake until you cancel:

```bash
systemd-inhibit --what=sleep --why="Keep awake for downloads" bash -c 'while :; do sleep 300; done'
```

4. Optional hard-disable of system sleep targets

- If you want to completely prevent sleep system-wide:

```bash
sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
```

- Re-enable later:

```bash
sudo systemctl unmask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
```

5. Verification checklist

- Logind shows idle ignore:

```bash
loginctl show-logind -p IdleAction -p IdleActionUSec
```

- No active Hypridle suspend action is present; only lock is configured (or Hypridle not running during long downloads).
- Inhibitors show expected blockers during downloads:

```bash
systemd-inhibit --list
```

- The system remains awake past your previous timeout (e.g., run a 20-minute no-op test):

```bash
timeout 1200 bash -c 'date; sleep 1200; date'
```

Note:

- ArchRiot does not restart systemd-logind during install/upgrade. After creating or modifying drop-ins under /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d, reboot to apply cleanly.
- Keeping the lock at 10 minutes while disabling suspend preserves security without interrupting transfers.

</div>

## üìã System Requirements

- **Fresh Arch Linux installation** (recommended)
- **Internet connection** for package downloads
- **4GB+ RAM** (8GB+ recommended for development)
- **8GB+ storage** (10GB+ for full development setup)
- **CPU:** Any modern processor (optimized for both Intel/AMD)
- **GPU:** Any modern graphics card (see GPU Support section for full compatibility details)

_Note: ArchRiot began as a unique rice[^1] and evolved from [DHH's Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) installer, but has since become a completely distinct Linux distribution based on Arch. It features a custom installer, advanced Go-based package management system, and many custom applications and tools focused on privacy, development productivity, and clean aesthetics._

[^1]: In the context of Linux, "rice" is slang for customizing or tweaking a desktop environment or user interface to make it look aesthetically pleasing or highly personalized, often with a focus on minimalism, unique themes, or lightweight setups. It comes from the term "ricer," originally used in car culture to describe heavily modified cars (inspired by "rice burner" for Japanese cars).

## üñ•Ô∏è VM & Hardware Notes

**ArchRiot is designed for bare metal hardware.** While it works perfectly in VMs, you're missing the full experience. This system is built to replace whatever disappointing Linux distribution you're currently stuck with. Install it on real hardware where it belongs.

**For VM testing:**

- **VirtualBox/VMware:** Works out of the box with the ArchRiot ISO
- **QEMU/KVM:** Full acceleration support with virtio drivers
- **Recommended VM specs:** 4GB+ RAM, 20GB+ storage, EFI boot enabled

**Hardware compatibility:**

- **Multi-GPU systems:** Automatic detection and driver installation
- **High-DPI displays:** Proper scaling across all applications
- **Gaming hardware:** Full support for NVIDIA/AMD/Intel graphics
- **Modern laptops:** Battery management, backlight control, and power profiles

### Fractional Scaling (Wayland) ‚Äî Behavior and Tips

- Per‚Äëmonitor scaling is supported and configured via Hyprland monitors (editable in `~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf`) or the Control Panel‚Äôs Display Settings.
- Wayland‚Äënative apps render crisply at fractional scales (e.g., 0.9, 1.25). XWayland apps may look slightly soft at non‚Äëinteger scales.
- Brave/PWAs: ArchRiot‚Äôs Brave wrapper sets `--force-device-scale-factor=1` and `--high-dpi-support=1` to prevent content shrink at scales below 1.0. Use per‚Äësite/page zoom in Brave for fine‚Äëtuning at >1.0 scales.
- Mixed‚ÄëDPI (multi‚Äëmonitor): Prefer per‚Äëmonitor Wayland scaling; avoid global Xft.dpi hacks. Use kanshi profiles if you hot‚Äëplug monitors frequently.
- Verification:
    - `hyprctl monitors` shows current scale per display
    - Waybar and GTK apps should scale cleanly as you adjust monitor scale
    - Screenshots reflect scaled geometry as expected
- Known quirks:
    - Some Electron apps under XWayland can appear soft at fractional scales ‚Äî install Wayland builds when available
    - Legacy toolkits may ignore fractional scaling; consider alternatives or run with specific toolkit flags if needed

# ArchRiot 3.2 Release Notes

Focused on persistence and UX polish for volume controls, keybindings, and SSH keys.

## Highlights

- No duplicate volume notifications
    - Hardware XF86 audio keybindings now invoke Volume.sh with --no-notify to prevent double toasts
    - Waybar visuals remain unchanged (scroll/click still works as before)
- Persistent user keybindings
    - Hyprland uses config/hypr/hyprland.conf directly by default (no separate keybindings.conf).
    - Installer preserves this file (alongside monitors.conf) so your binds survive repairs
- Shell persistence and SSH
    - Advises putting personal aliases in ~/.config/fish/conf.d/local.fish (preserved by installer)
    - Provides ~/.config/fish/conf.d/ssh-agent.fish (not installed by default). To enable: ln -s ~/.local/share/archriot/config/fish/conf.d/ssh-agent.fish ~/.config/fish/conf.d/ssh-agent.fish
- Unified fullscreen examples
    - Documented, optional binds you can enable in keybindings.conf:
        - bind = $mod, F11, fullscreen
        - bind = ALT, RETURN, fullscreen

## Upgrade

# ArchRiot 3.1 Release Notes

Focused on stability and UX polish related to Waybar modules, audio, and app bindings.

## Highlights

- AMD CPU temperature detection for Waybar custom temp module (k10temp/zenpower), plus Intel and generic fallbacks
- Waybar audio resiliency: volume module degrades gracefully when pamixer/PipeWire aren't ready, preventing crashes
- Hardware volume keys in Hyprland: XF86AudioRaiseVolume, XF86AudioLowerVolume, XF86AudioMute, XF86AudioMicMute wired to Volume.sh
- Keyboard settings launcher now respects $VISUAL/$EDITOR and falls back across common editors
- Bluesky launcher (.desktop) and PWA window rules for a consistent floating panel experience
- Waybar Mullvad module definition present; shows disconnected when Mullvad isn't installed

## Upgrade

```
curl -fsSL https://ArchRiot.org/setup.sh | bash
```

# ArchRiot 3.0 Release Notes

Focused on reliability, portability, and predictable behavior across diverse hardware ‚Äî while staying true to ArchRiot‚Äôs privacy-first, dev-centric philosophy.

## Highlights

- Waybar portability
    - Network module no longer hardcodes interface names; auto-detects reliably.
    - Temperature module no longer hardcodes hwmon paths; auto-detects sensors across hardware.
    - Flicker-free reloads via SIGUSR2 (no kill/restart).

- Screen recording indicator
    - Kooha recording dot shown as the left-most item on the right; click-to-stop recording.
    - Clean, lightweight PipeWire-based detection; zero idle footprint when idle.

- Portals stack aligned with Hyprland
    - Added xdg-desktop-portal, xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland, xdg-desktop-portal-gtk for consistent screencast/screenshot/file chooser behavior.

- Audio reliability
    - rtkit added for PipeWire/WirePlumber realtime scheduling under load.

- Memory tuning (opt-in)
    - When enabled, vm.min_free_kbytes ‚âà 1% of RAM (capped at 256MB) and overcommit heuristic (vm.overcommit_memory=0) to avoid exec starvation while maintaining responsiveness.

- GPU auto-detect
    - Installs the correct NVIDIA/AMD/Intel driver and VA stack based on lspci detection.

- Hyprlock polish
    - CPU and memory label refresh reduced to 5s to lower background CPU use while locked.

- Fuzzel stays
    - We do not use Walker; Fuzzel remains the launcher.

## Safer defaults

- TRIM disabled by default
    - No automatic fstrim.timer enablement (especially important for LUKS+btrfs). If you want weekly TRIM, enable `fstrim.timer` yourself and consider adding `discard` to your LUKS mapping (with the usual privacy trade-offs).

- Brave VA-API flags not forced
    - We didn‚Äôt add aggressive browser flags by default; if you want hardware decode, verify with `vainfo` and adjust your browser flags locally as needed.

## Deferred for a later update

- Secure Boot guided sbctl flow (end-to-end).
- Optional systemd-oomd integration (opt-in with protected slices).

## Upgrade

Run the one-liner:

```
curl -fsSL https://ArchRiot.org/setup.sh | bash
```

Thanks for the feedback and testing that shaped 3.0. This release focuses on rock-solid defaults and cross-hardware portability without compromising ArchRiot‚Äôs principles.
