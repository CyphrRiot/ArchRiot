## **ArchRiot: A Modern & Beautiful, Opinionated Arch Linux System**

ArchRiot is a privacy-focused Arch Linux setup that delivers a complete, functional environment with a single command. Built around the Hyprland tiling window manager for fast, keyboard-driven workflows.

**What You Get:**

- **One-Command Install:** Complete setup in minutes
- **Hyprland Tiling:** Efficient window management that enhances productivity
- **Development Ready:** Preconfigured with Zed IDE, nvim, and themes
- **Beautiful Aesthetics:** Custom themes with adaptive backgrounds for focused work
- **Privacy First:** No telemetry, no data collection, privacy-respecting applications
- **Fully Customizable:** Modify, extend, or strip down to your exact needs

_Created by an experienced developer and privacy advocate - this is the Linux system I've always wanted to use._

_Note: ArchRiot is very opinionated setup and was originally a unique rice[^1] and then a fork of [DHH's Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/){:target="\_blank"} installer with extensive customizations focused on privacy, development productivity, and clean aesthetics._

[^1]: In the context of Linux, "rice" is slang for customizing or tweaking a desktop environment or user interface to make it look aesthetically pleasing or highly personalized, often with a focus on minimalism, unique themes, or lightweight setups. It comes from the term "ricer," originally used in car culture to describe heavily modified cars (inspired by "rice burner" for Japanese cars).

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites: Fresh Arch Linux Setup

Download the Arch Linux ISO, put it on a USB stick (use balenaEtcher on Mac/Windows), and boot from the stick.

**WiFi Setup** (skip if using ethernet):

1. Run `iwctl`
2. Type `station wlan0 scan`
3. Type `station wlan0 connect <tab>`
4. Pick your network from the list
5. Enter your WiFi password

Run `archinstall` and pick these options (and leave anything not mentioned as-is):

| Section                  | Option                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mirrors and repositories | Select regions > Your country                                                  |
| Disk configuration       | Partitioning > Default partitioning layout > Select disk (with space + return) |
| Disk > File system       | btrfs (default structure: yes + use compression)                               |
| Disk > Disk encryption   | Encryption type: LUKS + Encryption password + Partitions (select the one)      |
| Hostname                 | Give your computer a name                                                      |
| Root password            | Set yours                                                                      |
| User account             | Add a user > Superuser: Yes > Confirm and exit                                 |
| Audio                    | pipewire                                                                       |
| Network configuration    | Copy ISO network config                                                        |
| Additional packages      | Add wget (type "/wget" to filter list)                                         |
| Timezone                 | Set yours                                                                      |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** You must setup disk encryption to use ArchRiot as designed! The setup relies exclusively on disk encryption to secure your device, as it'll auto-login the user after the disk has been decrypted at boot.

Once Arch has been installed, pick reboot, login with the user you just setup, and now you're ready to install ArchRiot.

### Method 1: One-Line Install or Upgrade (Recommended for Most Users)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archriot.org/setup.sh | bash
```

**Note: Upgrading is exactly the same command! Simple!**

### Method 2: Manual Clone (Only if You Need to Customize Installation Scripts)

Use this method only if you want to modify the installation scripts before running them:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyphrRiot/ArchRiot.git ~/.local/share/archriot
~/.local/share/archriot/install.sh
```

**Note:** Most users should use Method 1 above. This manual method is only for advanced users who need to customize the installation process.

## üñ•Ô∏è VM Installation Notes

_Thanks to [DTWaling on X](https://x.com/DTWaling) for VM installation guidance._

### Disk Partitioning in VirtualBox

The Arch Linux installer's auto partitioning might not detect the full disk space allocated by VirtualBox. If this happens, archinstall will partition based on the actual space pre-allocated by VirtualBox rather than the full virtual disk size.

**Solutions:**

1. **Pre-allocate full space:** In VirtualBox disk settings, pre-allocate the full disk space before installation
2. **Manual partitioning:** Use `gdisk` to create your own EFI boot and root partitions, then configure archinstall to use your pre-configured partitions

### Plymouth Installation Issues

If installation stops at the "running: plymouth" step (95% progress) and returns to command prompt:

**The installation is likely 99% complete!** Plymouth is a boot splash screen and not essential for desktop functionality.

**To complete installation:**

```bash
# Navigate to ArchRiot directory
cd ~/.local/share/archriot

# Complete remaining steps (run with bash in fish shell)
bash -c "sudo updatedb && fc-cache -fv"

# Verify core components
which waybar && echo "‚úì Waybar OK" || echo "‚ùå Waybar missing"
which hyprland && echo "‚úì Hyprland OK" || echo "‚ùå Hyprland missing"

# Reboot to apply all configurations
reboot
```

**To install Plymouth later:**

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/archriot
bash install/plymouth.sh
```

### Optional: Pre-Installation Validation

Want confidence before installing? Run the validation script to test compatibility:

```bash
wget https://cyphrriot.github.io/ArchRiot/validate.sh
bash validate.sh
```

This comprehensive test validates:

- System requirements (Arch Linux, internet, disk space)
- Package availability (Hyprland, Waybar, etc.)
- GPU compatibility and Wayland support
- Repository accessibility and theme integrity
- User environment and permissions

**Results**: Pass/fail report with specific guidance before you commit to installation.

### Installation Features

- **Automatic backup** - Creates timestamped backup of existing configs
- **Dependency verification** - Ensures Python3 and required packages
- **Script validation** - Verifies all waybar modules are functional
- **Error handling** - Clear feedback and rollback capability
- **100% confidence** - Comprehensive testing and validation

## üîç Post-Installation Validation

After installation completes, verify everything is working correctly:

### Automatic Validation

The installer automatically runs a post-installation check. If you need to run it manually:

```bash
~/.local/share/archriot/bin/post-install-check
```

### Manual Verification

Check these key components:

```bash
# Verify theme system
ls ~/.config/archriot/current/theme     # Should show active theme
ls ~/.config/archriot/current/background # Should show escape_velocity.jpg

# Test background cycling
SUPER + CTRL + SPACE                   # Should cycle through 6 backgrounds

# Test theme switching
theme-next                             # Should switch to next theme

# Verify waybar
pgrep waybar                          # Should show running process
```

### Expected Defaults

After fresh installation, you should see:

- **Default theme:** CypherRiot (purple/blue aesthetic)
- **Default background:** riot_zero.png (riot-themed wallpaper)
- **PDF files:** Show proper document icons (not thumbnails)
- **Image files:** Show thumbnail previews in Thunar
- **Waybar:** Running with tomato timer, system stats, and transparent microphone button

## üß™ Validation & Testing

### Pre-Installation Validation
