## **A customized Arch Linux Cypherpunk & Hacker setup**

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern development system based on Hyprland by running a single command.

ArchRiot is an even more opiniated setup and was originally a unique rice¬π and then a fork of [DHH's Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/archriot) installer with extensive customizations focused on privacy, development productivity, and clean aesthetics.

¬π _In the context of Linux, "rice" is slang for customizing or tweaking a desktop environment or user interface to make it look aesthetically pleasing or highly personalized, often with a focus on minimalism, unique themes, or lightweight setups. It comes from the term "ricer," originally used in car culture to describe heavily modified cars (inspired by "rice burner" for Japanese cars)._

_Created by a hacker, cypherpunk, and blockchain developer with decades of experience running Linux and Unix - this is the system I've always wanted._

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites: Fresh Arch Linux Setup

Download the Arch Linux ISO, put it on a USB stick (use balenaEtcher on Mac/Windows), and boot from the stick.

**WiFi Setup** (skip if using ethernet):

1. Run `iwctl`
2. Type `station wlan0 scan`
3. Type `station wlan0 connect <tab>`
4. Pick your network from the list
5. Enter your WiFi password

Run `archinstall` and pick these options (and leave anything not mentioned as-is):

| Section                  | Option                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mirrors and repositories | Select regions > Your country                                                  |
| Disk configuration       | Partitioning > Default partitioning layout > Select disk (with space + return) |
| Disk > File system       | btrfs (default structure: yes + use compression)                               |
| Disk > Disk encryption   | Encryption type: LUKS + Encryption password + Partitions (select the one)      |
| Hostname                 | Give your computer a name                                                      |
| Root password            | Set yours                                                                      |
| User account             | Add a user > Superuser: Yes > Confirm and exit                                 |
| Audio                    | pipewire                                                                       |
| Network configuration    | Copy ISO network config                                                        |
| Additional packages      | Add wget (type "/wget" to filter list)                                         |
| Timezone                 | Set yours                                                                      |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** You must setup disk encryption to use ArchRiot as designed! The setup relies exclusively on disk encryption to secure your device, as it'll auto-login the user after the disk has been decrypted at boot.

Once Arch has been installed, pick reboot, login with the user you just setup, and now you're ready to install ArchRiot.

### Method 1: One-Line Install or Upgrade (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archriot.org/setup.sh | bash
```

**Note: Upgrading is exactly the same command! Simple!**

### Method 2: Manual Clone (For Customization)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyphrRiot/ArchRiot.git ~/.local/share/archriot
~/.local/share/archriot/install.sh
```

### Optional: Pre-Installation Validation

Want confidence before installing? Run the validation script to test compatibility:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyphrRiot/ArchRiot/master/validate-installation.sh | bash
```

This comprehensive test validates:

- System requirements (Arch Linux, internet, disk space)
- Package availability (Hyprland, Waybar, etc.)
- GPU compatibility and Wayland support
- Repository accessibility and theme integrity
- User environment and permissions

**Results**: Pass/fail report with specific guidance before you commit to installation.

### Installation Features

- **Automatic backup** - Creates timestamped backup of existing configs
- **Dependency verification** - Ensures Python3 and required packages
- **Script validation** - Verifies all waybar modules are functional
- **Error handling** - Clear feedback and rollback capability
- **100% confidence** - Comprehensive testing and validation

- **Browser:** Brave (replaces Chromium) with native Wayland support
- **File Manager:** Thunar (replaces Nautilus) with comprehensive dark theming
- **Shell:** Fish as default (replaces Bash) with proper PATH configuration

#### üß† **Memory Management Fix**

Linux's default memory management is **aggressively stupid** about caching. The kernel will happily consume 90%+ of your RAM for file caches, then struggle to free it when applications actually need memory.

ArchRiot fixes this with intelligent memory management tuning:

- **No more lag spikes** when opening applications
- **Better responsiveness** under memory pressure
- **Reduced swap usage** with proper RAM utilization
- **Optimized caching** that doesn't hog system resources

**Result:** Your system stays fast and responsive even when running multiple applications.

```bash
~/.local/share/archriot/bin/post-install-check
```

### Manual Verification

Check these key components:

```bash
# Verify theme system
ls ~/.config/archriot/current/theme     # Should show active theme
ls ~/.config/archriot/current/background # Should show escape_velocity.jpg

# Test background cycling
SUPER + CTRL + SPACE                   # Should cycle through 6 backgrounds

# Test theme switching
theme-next                             # Should switch to next theme

# Verify waybar
pgrep waybar                          # Should show running process
```

### Expected Defaults

After fresh installation, you should see:

- **Default theme:** CypherRiot (purple/blue aesthetic)
- **Default background:** riot_zero.png (riot-themed wallpaper)
- **PDF files:** Show proper document icons (not thumbnails)
- **Image files:** Show thumbnail previews in Thunar
- **Waybar:** Running with tomato timer, system stats, and transparent microphone button

## üß™ Validation & Testing

### Pre-Installation Validation

Before installing, you can run a comprehensive validation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyphrRiot/ArchRiot/master/validate-installation.sh | bash
```

**What it tests:**

- System compatibility (Arch Linux, hardware, drivers)
- Internet connectivity and package availability
- Repository accessibility and file integrity
- Wayland/Hyprland compatibility
- Theme files and expected installation outcome

**Results**: Detailed pass/fail report with 30+ validation checks
