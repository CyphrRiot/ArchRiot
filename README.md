## **ArchRiot: The (Arch) Linux System You've Always Wanted**

**One Command. Complete Environment. Zero Compromises.**

ArchRiot isn't just another Linux distribution -- it's the answer to every time you've thought "why can't Linux just work flawlessly from the start?" We obsess over speed, security, and getting every detail perfect so you don't have to.

**This is what perfect looks like:**

- **Hyprland Tiling WM** - Because floating windows are chaos
- **Go Binary Installer** - Atomic operations, zero failures, complete rollback
- **Privacy by Design** - No telemetry, no tracking, no corporate surveillance
- **CypherRiot Aesthetics** - Dark themes that don't hurt your eyes at 3 AM
- **Development-First** - Zed, nvim, containers, and tools that just work

_Built on Arch Linux with Hyprland, because compromises are for other people. This isn't maintained by committee or corporate roadmap -- it's maintained by someone with an obsessive, singular focus on getting it right the first time, every time, because broken Linux systems are an insult to what computing should be._

üéâ Thank you [Vaxryy](https://x.com/vaxryy) for creating Hyprland‚Äîthe compositor that doesn't suck.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites: Fresh Arch Linux Setup

Download the [Arch Linux ISO](https://archlinux.org/download), put it on a USB stick (use balenaEtcher on Mac/Windows), and boot from the stick. You can also use [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) which is quite simple compared to other options.

**WiFi Setup** (skip if using ethernet):

1. Run `iwctl`
2. Type `station wlan0 scan`
3. Type `station wlan0 connect <tab>`
4. Pick your network from the list
5. Enter your WiFi password

Run `archinstall` and pick these options (and leave anything not mentioned as-is):

| Section                  | Option                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mirrors and repositories | Select regions > Your country                                           |
| Disk configuration       | Partitioning > Default partitioning layout > Select disk (SPACE+RETURN) |
| Disk > File system       | btrfs (default structure: yes + use compression)                        |
| Disk > Disk encryption   | Encryption type: LUKS + Encryption password + Partitions (select)       |
| Hostname                 | Give your computer a name                                               |
| Root password            | Set yours                                                               |
| User account             | Add a user > Superuser: Yes > Confirm and exit                          |
| Audio                    | pipewire                                                                |
| Network configuration    | Copy ISO network config                                                 |
| Timezone                 | Set yours                                                               |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** You must setup disk encryption to use ArchRiot as designed! The setup relies exclusively on disk encryption to secure your device, as it'll auto-login the user after the disk has been decrypted at boot.

Once Arch has been installed, pick reboot, login with the user you just setup, and now you're ready to install ArchRiot.

### Method 1: One-Line Install or Upgrade (Recommended for Most Users)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archriot.org/setup.sh | bash
```

![ArchRiot Upgrade Demo](config/images/upgrade.gif)

This downloads and runs the pre-built ArchRiot installer binary with YAML-based configuration. The installer automatically handles package installation, configuration deployment, and system setup.

**Note: Upgrading is exactly the same command! Simple!**

### Why Go + YAML Dominates Shell Scripts

ArchRiot has evolved beyond the fragile, error-prone shell script installations that plague most Linux distributions. Our architecture represents a quantum leap in system reliability and maintainability:

**Technical Superiority:**

- **Go Binary**: Compiled, statically-linked executable with proper error handling, structured logging, and predictable behavior across environments
- **YAML Configuration**: Declarative, type-safe configuration that eliminates shell script parsing nightmares and variable expansion hell
- **Dependency Resolution**: Intelligent module dependency management that traditional shell scripts simply cannot provide
- **Atomic Operations**: Proper transaction-like behavior with rollback capabilities, unlike shell scripts that fail halfway and leave systems in broken states
- **Memory Safety**: No shell injection vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, or undefined behavior that plague bash-based installers

**What We Left Behind:**

- Shell script fragility where a single missing quote breaks everything
- Untracked state changes scattered across hundreds of script files
- Zero error recovery when installations fail partway through
- Impossible-to-debug variable scoping and expansion issues
- Platform-dependent shell behavior causing random failures
- No validation of configuration before execution

The result: **100% reliable installations** with **complete system state management** that shell scripts could never achieve. This isn't just an upgrade‚Äîit's architectural superiority.

### Installation Features

- **Preserves Critical Configs** - Won't overwrite your key configurations
- **Dependency verification** - Ensures Python3 and required packages
- **Script validation** - Verifies all waybar modules are functional
- **Error handling** - Clear feedback and rollback capability
- **100% confidence** - Comprehensive testing and validation

### Updates

**System Updates:**

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu                     # Standard Arch Linux system update
yay -Syu                             # Update AUR packages
```

**ArchRiot Updates:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archriot.org/setup.sh | bash    # Update ArchRiot (same as install)
```

**Automatic Update Notifications**: ArchRiot automatically checks for updates every 4 hours and shows a notification dialog when newer versions are available. You can install updates, ignore notifications, or simply close the dialog.

<div align="center">
<img src="config/images/upgrade.png" alt="ArchRiot Update Dialog" width="600">
<br><em>Waybar update notifications: Û∞ö∞ (new), Û±ßò (seen), - (up-to-date) with one-click upgrade dialog</em>
</div>

The ArchRiot updater downloads the latest YAML configuration and pre-built binary, then intelligently applies only the changes needed. The YAML-based system ensures **atomic updates** with proper dependency resolution - no partial failures or broken states like traditional shell script updaters.

### Backup & Restore

```bash
migrate
```

**üéØ Migrate** is a separate project by Cypher Riot that gets automatically installed during ArchRiot setup. It's a TUI (Text User Interface) with **no command-line options**. Simply run the command and use the interactive menu to:

- Create comprehensive system backups
- Restore from previous backups
- Migrate configurations between installations
- Preserve all your customizations

**Integration Details:** ArchRiot automatically downloads and installs the latest version of Migrate from [CypherRiot/Migrate](https://github.com/CyphrRiot/Migrate) during installation, ensuring you always have the most current backup capabilities without any manual setup.

- **Application consistency:** CypherRiot theme provides unified styling across all applications

## Understanding the YAML Configuration

**For developers and power users who want to customize the system before installation:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyphrRiot/ArchRiot.git ~/.local/share/archriot
# Edit install/packages.yaml to customize
~/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot
```

### YAML Architecture

ArchRiot uses a modern YAML-based configuration system that replaces traditional shell scripts. The entire system is defined in `install/packages.yaml`, which contains:

**Structure:**

- **Categories** (core, desktop, development, system, media)
- **Modules** within each category (base, hyprland, tools, etc.)
- **Each module defines:**
    - `packages:` - List of packages to install
    - `configs:` - Configuration files to deploy with patterns and targets
    - `commands:` - Post-installation commands to run
    - `depends:` - Dependencies on other modules
    - `type:` - Installation type (pacman, yay, flatpak, etc.)

**Example module:**

```yaml
desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, wofi, hyprpaper]
        configs:
            - pattern: "config/hypr/*"
              target: "~/.config/hypr/"
              preserve_if_exists: [monitors.conf]
            - pattern: "config/waybar/*"
              target: "~/.config/waybar/"
        commands: ["systemctl --user enable hyprland"]
        depends: [core.base]
        type: pacman
```

This YAML system provides clean separation of packages, configurations, and commands while maintaining full dependency resolution and proper installation ordering.

## üîç Installation Verification System

ArchRiot includes a comprehensive verification system to ensure everything is working correctly:

### What the Installer Actually Does

The ArchRiot installer validates everything automatically as it runs. You don't need separate validation because the installer IS the validation system:

**Real-time validation during installation:**

- YAML configuration integrity and module dependencies
- Essential packages (yay, git, base-devel)
- Desktop environment (Hyprland, Waybar, fuzzel, mako)
- Configuration file deployment verification
- Applications (terminal, file manager, browser, text editor)
- System services (audio, network, bluetooth)
- Network connectivity and repository accessibility
- Memory, disk space, and system requirements

**If anything fails:** The installer stops immediately with clear error messages and diagnostic information. Fix the issue and re-run - it's completely safe and idempotent.

- **Detailed failure analysis** with specific recommendations
- **Fix suggestions** for failed components

### Verification

Installation logs are in `~/.cache/archriot/install.log` and can be reviewed for the full installation details or any errors during the installation process.

### Expected Defaults

After fresh installation, you should see:

- **Default theme:** CypherRiot (Neo Tokyo Dark aesthetic)
- **Default background:** riot_zero.png (riot-themed wallpaper)
- **PDF files:** Show proper document icons (not thumbnails)
- **Image files:** Show thumbnail previews in Thunar
- **Waybar:** Running with tomato timer, system stats, and transparent microphone button

## üß™ Validation & Testing

### System Health Validation

The ArchRiot installer performs comprehensive validation automatically:

**Built-in validation includes:**

- YAML configuration integrity and module dependency resolution
- System compatibility (Arch Linux, hardware, drivers)
- Package availability and repository accessibility
- Network connectivity and download verification
- Configuration file deployment and permissions
- Service startup and functionality testing
- Complete dependency tree validation

**Real-time feedback:** Progress bars, status updates, and immediate error reporting if anything goes wrong. The installer won't continue if any validation step fails.

_Note: ArchRiot is very opinionated setup and was originally a unique rice[^1] and then a fork of [DHH's Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/){:target="\_blank"} installer with extensive customizations focused on privacy, development productivity, and clean aesthetics._

[^1]: In the context of Linux, "rice" is slang for customizing or tweaking a desktop environment or user interface to make it look aesthetically pleasing or highly personalized, often with a focus on minimalism, unique themes, or lightweight setups. It comes from the term "ricer," originally used in car culture to describe heavily modified cars (inspired by "rice burner" for Japanese cars).

## üñ•Ô∏è VM & Hardware Notes

**ArchRiot is designed for bare metal hardware.** While it can run in VMs, you're missing the point‚Äîthis system is built to replace whatever disappointing Linux distribution you're currently stuck with. Install it on real hardware where it belongs.

**That said, if you insist on VMs:**

_Thanks to [DTWaling on X](https://x.com/DTWaling) for VM installation guidance._

### Disk Partitioning in VirtualBox

The Arch Linux installer's auto partitioning might not detect the full disk space allocated by VirtualBox. If this happens, archinstall will partition based on the actual space pre-allocated by VirtualBox rather than the full virtual disk size.

**Solutions:**

1. **Pre-allocate full space:** In VirtualBox disk settings, pre-allocate the full disk space before installation
2. **Manual partitioning:** Use `gdisk` to create your own EFI boot and root partitions, then configure archinstall to use your pre-configured partitions

### Plymouth Installation Issues

If installation stops at the "running: plymouth" step (95% progress) and returns to command prompt:

**The installation is likely 99% complete!** Plymouth is a boot splash screen and not essential for desktop functionality.

**To complete installation:**

```bash
# Complete remaining steps
sudo updatedb && fc-cache -fv

# Verify core components
which waybar && echo "‚úì Waybar OK" || echo "‚ùå Waybar missing"
which hyprland && echo "‚úì Hyprland OK" || echo "‚ùå Hyprland missing"

# Check if key components are working

# Reboot to apply all configurations
reboot
```

**To install Plymouth later:**

```bash
# Re-run installer to complete Plymouth installation
curl -fsSL https://archriot.org/setup.sh | bash
```

### Post-Installation

If the installer completes successfully, your system is fully functional. The installer validates every component during installation - if it finishes, everything works.

**No separate verification needed.** The installer already validated:

- All packages installed correctly
- All configurations deployed properly
- All services started successfully
- All dependencies resolved

**Issues after installation?** Re-run the installer - it's designed to fix problems and maintain your system.
