# OhmArchy

**A customized Arch Linux setup based on Omarchy, optimized for the CypherRiot workflow.**

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern development system based on Hyprland by running a single command.

OhmArchy is an even more opiniated personal fork of [Basecamp's Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) with extensive customizations focused on privacy, development productivity, and clean aesthetics.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites: Fresh Arch Linux Setup

Download the Arch Linux ISO, put it on a USB stick (use balenaEtcher on Mac/Windows), and boot from the stick.

If you're on wifi, start by running `iwctl`, then type `station wlan0 scan`, then `station wlan0 connect <tab>`, pick your network, and enter the password. If you're on ethernet, you don't need this.

Run `archinstall` and pick these options (and leave anything not mentioned as-is):

| Section                  | Option                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mirrors and repositories | Select regions > Your country                                                  |
| Disk configuration       | Partitioning > Default partitioning layout > Select disk (with space + return) |
| Disk > File system       | btrfs (default structure: yes + use compression)                               |
| Disk > Disk encryption   | Encryption type: LUKS + Encryption password + Partitions (select the one)      |
| Hostname                 | Give your computer a name                                                      |
| Root password            | Set yours                                                                      |
| User account             | Add a user > Superuser: Yes > Confirm and exit                                 |
| Audio                    | pipewire                                                                       |
| Network configuration    | Copy ISO network config                                                        |
| Additional packages      | Add wget (type "/wget" to filter list)                                         |
| Timezone                 | Set yours                                                                      |

**⚠️ Important:** You must setup disk encryption to use OhmArchy as designed! The setup relies exclusively on disk encryption to secure your device, as it'll auto-login the user after the disk has been decrypted at boot.

Once Arch has been installed, pick reboot, login with the user you just setup, and now you're ready to install OhmArchy.

### Method 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cyphrriot.github.io/OhmArchy/setup.sh | bash
```

### Method 2: Manual Clone (For Customization)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyphrRiot/OhmArchy.git ~/.local/share/omarchy
~/.local/share/omarchy/install.sh
```

### Optional: Pre-Installation Validation

Want confidence before installing? Run the validation script to test compatibility:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyphrRiot/OhmArchy/master/validate-installation.sh | bash
```

This comprehensive test validates:

- System requirements (Arch Linux, internet, disk space)
- Package availability (Hyprland, Waybar, etc.)
- GPU compatibility and Wayland support
- Repository accessibility and theme integrity
- User environment and permissions

**Results**: Pass/fail report with specific guidance before you commit to installation.

### Installation Features

- **Automatic backup** - Creates timestamped backup of existing configs
- **Dependency verification** - Ensures Python3 and required packages
- **Script validation** - Verifies all waybar modules are functional
- **Error handling** - Clear feedback and rollback capability
- **100% confidence** - Comprehensive testing and validation

## 🎯 Key Customizations

### 🔧 **Core System Changes**

- **Terminal:** Kitty (replaces Alacritty) with 90% transparency and dark theme
- **Browser:** Brave (replaces Chromium) with native Wayland support
- **File Manager:** Thunar (replaces Nautilus) with comprehensive dark theming
- **Shell:** Fish as default (replaces Bash) with proper PATH configuration
- **Theme:** CypherRiot as default (replaces Tokyo Night)
- **Code Editor:** Zed (Wayland) + Neovim with proper theme integration
- **Applications:** All major apps now run native Wayland (no more XWayland issues)
- **Backup Tool:** Latest migrate binary for comprehensive system backup/restore
- **Memory Optimization:** Intelligent memory management that actually works
- **Blue Light Filter:** Automatic hyprsunset at 4000K for reduced eye strain
- **GTK Theming:** Dark theme everywhere - no more jarring white dialogs
- **DPI Scaling:** Fixed scaling issues for consistent UI across all applications

#### 🧠 **Memory Management Fix**

Linux's default memory management is **aggressively stupid** about caching. The kernel will happily consume 90%+ of your RAM for file caches, then struggle to free it when applications actually need memory. This causes:

- **Lag spikes** when opening new applications
- **Swap thrashing** even with plenty of "free" RAM
- **Poor responsiveness** during memory pressure
- **Misleading memory reports** (cached ≠ available)

**OhmArchy fixes this with intelligent sysctl tuning:**

```bash
vm.min_free_kbytes=1048576    # Always keep 1GB truly free
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50      # Be less aggressive about caching
vm.swappiness=10              # Prefer RAM over swap usage
vm.dirty_ratio=5              # Limit dirty page cache buildup
```

**Result:** Your system maintains responsive performance with proper memory pressure handling, ensuring applications get the RAM they need without the kernel being stubborn about giving up its precious caches.

```bash
~/.local/share/omarchy/bin/omarchy-post-install-check
```

### Manual Verification

Check these key components:

```bash
# Verify theme system
ls ~/.config/omarchy/current/theme     # Should show active theme
ls ~/.config/omarchy/current/background # Should show escape_velocity.jpg

# Test background cycling
SUPER + CTRL + SPACE                   # Should cycle through 6 backgrounds

# Test theme switching
omarchy-theme-next                     # Should switch to next theme

# Verify waybar
pgrep waybar                          # Should show running process
```

### Expected Defaults

After fresh installation, you should see:

- **Default theme:** CypherRiot (purple/blue aesthetic)
- **Default background:** escape_velocity.jpg (space/galaxy scene)
- **PDF files:** Show proper document icons (not thumbnails)
- **Image files:** Show thumbnail previews in Thunar
- **Waybar:** Running with tomato timer, system stats, and transparent microphone button

## 🧪 Validation & Testing

### Pre-Installation Validation

Before installing, you can run a comprehensive validation script:
