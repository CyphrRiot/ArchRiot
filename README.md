## **ArchRiot: The (Arch) Linux System You've Always Wanted**

**One Command. Complete Environment. Zero Compromises.**

ArchRiot is the answer to every time you've thought "why can't Linux just work correctly from the start?" We've spent hundreds of hours perfecting the details so you get a blazing-fast, secure, beautiful system that actually respects your time and intelligence.

**Curated to be correct:**

- **ü™ü Hyprland Tiling WM** - Makes other Window Managers feel primitive
- **‚ö° Go Binary Installer** - Atomic operations, instant rollbacks, zero dependency hell
- **üõ°Ô∏è Privacy by Design** - Zero telemetry, zero tracking, zero corporate data harvesting
- **üé® CypherRiot Aesthetics** - Carefully crafted dark themes that work at any hour
- **üíª Development-First** - Zed, Neovim, shell enhancements, and other upgrades

_Built on Arch Linux with Hyprland, because compromises are for other people. This isn't maintained by committee or corporate roadmap -- it's maintained by someone with an obsessive, singular focus on getting it right the first time, because crappy Linux environments are an insult to what computing should be._

#### üöÄ One-Line Install or Upgrade

**The only command you need to remember:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ArchRiot.org/setup.sh | bash
```

![ArchRiot Upgrade Demo](config/images/upgrade.gif)

This downloads and runs our bulletproof Go binary installer with intelligent YAML configuration. Upgrading is exactly the same command - because simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

**What happens:** Automatic package installation, configuration deployment, and system setup with complete rollback capability if anything goes wrong.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Blinking Cursor Instead of Hyprland

If your system boots to a **blinking cursor** instead of starting Hyprland:

1. **Get to a terminal:** Press `CTRL+ALT+F3`
2. **Login** with your username and password
3. **Re-run the installer** to fix GPU/graphics issues:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://ArchRiot.org/setup.sh | bash
    ```
4. **Reboot** after the script completes

This issue is almost always GPU-related and the installer will detect and fix graphics driver problems automatically.

#### üß† **Memory Management Fix**

Linux's default memory management is **aggressively stupid** about caching. The kernel will happily consume 90%+ of your RAM for file caches, then struggle to free it when applications actually need memory.

**ArchRiot's Solution:** Comprehensive memory management tuning that provides:

**Core Improvements:**

- **Smart Caching** - Reserves 1GB RAM, reduces aggressive file system caching
- **Minimal Swapping** - 10% swappiness (vs 60% default) keeps everything in RAM
- **Lag-Free Writing** - 5% dirty page limit prevents massive write bursts
- **Background Cleanup** - 2% background writeback for smooth performance

**Advanced Protection:**

- **Memory Overcommit Control** - Prevents dangerous memory allocation that causes crashes
- **Proactive Defragmentation** - Reduces memory fragmentation for better allocation
- **Smart OOM Killer** - Kills problematic processes, not random system services
- **Enhanced Responsiveness** - Optimized dirty page intervals and memory bandwidth

**Real-World Impact:**

- **No more lag spikes** when opening applications or switching windows
- **Better responsiveness** under heavy memory pressure (tested with 75%+ RAM usage)
- **Reduced swap usage** with intelligent RAM utilization
- **System stability** under extreme load - no freezes or crashes

**Result:** Your system stays fast and responsive even when running multiple applications, compiling code, or under extreme stress testing.

### üì± **Advanced Waybar Integration**

## üîÑ System Management

### Updates

**System Updates:**

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu                     # Standard Arch Linux system update
yay -Syu                             # Update AUR packages
```

**ArchRiot Updates:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archriot.org/setup.sh | bash    # Update ArchRiot (same as install)
```

**Automatic Update Notifications**: ArchRiot automatically checks for updates every 4 hours and shows a notification dialog when newer versions are available. You can install updates, ignore notifications, or simply close the dialog.

<div align="center">
<img src="config/images/upgrade.png" alt="ArchRiot Update Dialog" width="600">
<br><em>Waybar update notifications: Û∞ö∞ (new), Û±ßò (seen), - (up-to-date) with one-click upgrade dialog</em>
</div>

The ArchRiot updater downloads the latest YAML configuration and pre-built binary, then intelligently applies only the changes needed. The YAML-based system ensures **atomic updates** with proper dependency resolution - no partial failures or broken states like traditional shell script updaters.

### Backup & Restore

```bash
migrate
```

**üéØ Migrate** is a separate project by Cypher Riot that gets automatically installed during ArchRiot setup. It's a TUI (Text User Interface) with **no command-line options**. Simply run the command and use the interactive menu to:

- Create comprehensive system backups
- Restore from previous backups
- Migrate configurations between installations
- Preserve all your customizations

**Integration Details:** ArchRiot automatically downloads and installs the latest version of Migrate from [CypherRiot/Migrate](https://github.com/CyphrRiot/Migrate) during installation, ensuring you always have the most current backup capabilities without any manual setup.

## üé® CypherRiot Theme System

There is one theme: **CypherRiot**, a beautiful Neo Tokyo Dark inspired theme. If you don't like it, the theme files are at `~/.local/share/archriot/config/` and can be edited.

**Visual Design:**

- **Style:** Custom Neo Tokyo Dark aesthetic with dark elegance
- **Color Palette:** Deep purples, electric blues, and charcoal backgrounds
- **Integration:** Complete system theming (waybar, hyprlock, fuzzel, terminals, applications)
- **Backgrounds:** 23 riot-themed wallpapers for dynamic cycling

**System Integration:**

- **Custom backgrounds:** Add your own wallpapers to the backgrounds directory
- **Script integration:** Background cycling integrates with waybar and system status
- **Application consistency:** CypherRiot theme provides unified styling across all applications

## Understanding the YAML Configuration

**For developers and power users who want to customize the system before installation:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyphrRiot/ArchRiot.git ~/.local/share/archriot
# Edit install/packages.yaml to customize
~/.local/share/archriot/install/archriot
```

### YAML Architecture

ArchRiot uses a modern YAML-based configuration system that replaces traditional shell scripts. The entire system is defined in `install/packages.yaml`, which contains:

**Structure:**

- **Categories** (core, desktop, development, system, media)
- **Modules** within each category (base, hyprland, tools, etc.)
- **Each module defines:**
    - `packages:` - List of packages to install
    - `configs:` - Configuration files to deploy with patterns and targets
    - `commands:` - Post-installation commands to run
    - `depends:` - Dependencies on other modules
    - `type:` - Installation type (pacman, yay, flatpak, etc.)

**Example module:**

```yaml
desktop:
    hyprland:
        packages: [hyprland, waybar, wofi, hyprpaper]
        configs:
            - pattern: "config/hypr/*"
              target: "~/.config/hypr/"
              preserve_if_exists: [monitors.conf]
            - pattern: "config/waybar/*"
              target: "~/.config/waybar/"
        commands: ["systemctl --user enable hyprland"]
        depends: [core.base]
        type: pacman
```

This YAML system provides clean separation of packages, configurations, and commands while maintaining full dependency resolution and proper installation ordering.

### Configuration Preservation

ArchRiot includes an intelligent preservation system via `install/preserve.yaml` that maintains your personal customizations during upgrades and reinstalls. This ensures your keyboard layout, application preferences, and other settings survive system updates.

**Preserved Settings:**

- **Keyboard Configuration** - Layout (us, fr, de), variant, and model
- **Default Applications** - Browser, terminal, file manager, and dock preferences
- **User Customizations** - Any settings you've modified in Hyprland configs

**How It Works:**

1. **Detection** - Scans existing configs for user-customizable settings
2. **Backup** - Creates timestamped backups in `~/.cache/archriot/`
3. **Extraction** - Pulls out your personal settings using defined patterns
4. **Restoration** - Optionally applies saved settings to new configs

**Example preserve.yaml entry:**

```yaml
user_customizable_settings:
    - name: "kb_layout"
      description: "Keyboard layout (us, fr, de, etc.)"
      pattern: "kb_layout"

    - name: "browser"
      description: "Default browser application"
      pattern: "$browser"
```

The system prompts during installation: **"Restore your hyprland modifications?"** allowing you to choose whether to apply your saved preferences to the fresh configuration.

## üîç Installation Verification System

ArchRiot includes a comprehensive verification system to ensure everything is working correctly:

### What the Installer Actually Does

The ArchRiot installer validates everything automatically as it runs. You don't need separate validation because the installer IS the validation system:

**Real-time validation during installation:**

- YAML configuration integrity and module dependencies
- Essential packages (yay, git, base-devel)
- Desktop environment (Hyprland, Waybar, fuzzel, mako)
- Configuration file deployment verification
- Applications (terminal, file manager, browser, text editor)
- System services (audio, network, bluetooth)
- Network connectivity and repository accessibility
- Memory, disk space, and system requirements

**If anything fails:** The installer stops immediately with clear error messages and diagnostic information. Fix the issue and re-run - it's completely safe and idempotent.

- **Detailed failure analysis** with specific recommendations
- **Fix suggestions** for failed components

### Verification

Installation logs are in `~/.cache/archriot/install.log` and can be reviewed for the full installation details or any errors during the installation process.

### Expected Defaults

After fresh installation, you should see:

- **Default theme:** CypherRiot (Neo Tokyo Dark aesthetic)
- **Default background:** riot_zero.png (riot-themed wallpaper)
- **PDF files:** Show proper document icons (not thumbnails)
- **Image files:** Show thumbnail previews in Thunar
- **Waybar:** Running with tomato timer, system stats, and transparent microphone button

</div>

## üìã System Requirements

- **Fresh Arch Linux installation** (recommended)
- **Internet connection** for package downloads
- **4GB+ RAM** (8GB+ recommended for development)
- **8GB+ storage** (10GB+ for full development setup)
- **CPU:** Any modern processor (optimized for both Intel/AMD)
- **GPU:** Any modern graphics card (see GPU Support section for full compatibility details)

_Note: ArchRiot began as a unique rice[^1] and evolved from [DHH's Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) installer, but has since become a completely distinct Linux distribution based on Arch. It features a custom installer, advanced Go-based package management system, and many custom applications and tools focused on privacy, development productivity, and clean aesthetics._

[^1]: In the context of Linux, "rice" is slang for customizing or tweaking a desktop environment or user interface to make it look aesthetically pleasing or highly personalized, often with a focus on minimalism, unique themes, or lightweight setups. It comes from the term "ricer," originally used in car culture to describe heavily modified cars (inspired by "rice burner" for Japanese cars).

## üñ•Ô∏è VM & Hardware Notes

**ArchRiot is designed for bare metal hardware.** While it works perfectly in VMs, you're missing the full experience. This system is built to replace whatever disappointing Linux distribution you're currently stuck with. Install it on real hardware where it belongs.

**For VM testing:**

- **VirtualBox/VMware:** Works out of the box with the ArchRiot ISO
- **QEMU/KVM:** Full acceleration support with virtio drivers
- **Recommended VM specs:** 4GB+ RAM, 20GB+ storage, EFI boot enabled
