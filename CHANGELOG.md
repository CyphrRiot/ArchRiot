## [2.0.15] - 2025-07-30

### üö® Critical Bug Fix

#### Media Applications Installation Error

- **Fixed "print_status: command not found" error** in media.sh during installation
- **Root cause**: Added function calls to script that doesn't source helper libraries
- **Solution**: Replaced unavailable functions with direct commands and echo statements
- **Impact**: Prevents installation failure at media applications step
- **Added print_status to exported functions** for scripts that do source helpers
- **Maintained spotdl --nocheck functionality** with proper availability

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements

#### Installation Speed Optimization

- **Eliminated excessive temp file operations** during module execution
- **Root cause**: Every module created/wrote/deleted temp files unnecessarily
- **Solution**: Direct logging via `tee -a` instead of temp file + cat + rm operations
- **Impact**: Significantly faster installations, especially for already-installed packages
- **Reduced I/O operations** from 4 file operations to 1 per module
- **Maintains all functionality** (output visibility, error handling, complete logging)

This optimization resolves slow package installations (e.g., brave-bin taking 30+ seconds when already installed).
